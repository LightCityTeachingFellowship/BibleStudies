<h1><a name="_Toc431096673"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>The atoning work of Christ brought about a reversal of the alienation of men, which implies, a restoration to a former state. Indeed, many of the things Christ accomplished for us are a restoration but not all are.</p>
<p>As for our alienation, take note that though both Jews and Gentiles were alienated from God, it was really the Gentiles who were alienated. As for the Jews, they had most of the privileges the pre-alienation generations had, but with limitations placed on them through the Law.</p>
<p>As you go through this study, try to see in what ways Gentiles were far away but Jews were near to God and try to understand what diminished the value of the nearness of the Jew.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc432885044"></a>Things that Jesus Accomplished for Men</h1>
<p>The following are some of the things Jesus accomplished for us through his atonement,</p>
<ol>
<li>Reconciliation to God [2Co 5:18-20]<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></li>
<li>Abolishment of the Law
<ol>
<li>The Law was introduced as part of the alienation of men for the Law brought limitations upon the people of God, the Jews. The Law could have been a solution, but its design ensured that it became more of a problem than a solution.</li>
<li>Sin was a problem, whether or not there was a Law, and the Law tried to bring about forgiveness but failed [Heb 9:9; 10:1-4]<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></li>
<li>The Law offered eternal life [Gal 3:12] but instead, through transgression, strengthened the reign of death which was the result of Adam&rsquo;s transgression in the Garden of Eden.</li>
<li>Because of transgression, the Law made justification by faith impossible&mdash;no one can be justified under the Law</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Grace, forgiveness of sins</li>
</ol>
<p>Our sins have two major consequences which Christ&rsquo;s work deals with,</p>
<ol>
<li>We were alienated from God on account of our sins. Therefore to be reconciled to God, our sins had to be forgiven</li>
<li>God cut off all men from the hope of eternal life on account of our sins.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Jews were nearer to God, and on account of the Law had the hope of eternal life for the Law offered them life [Gal 3:12<em>b</em>,21<em>b</em>]<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a>. On account of their transgressions [Rom 4:15]<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> of the Law however, they could not be given eternal life [Rom 7:10-11]<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Truth [Joh 1:17]<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> as opposed to types and shadows [Col 2:17]<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a>
<ol>
<li>Even before our alienation, we did not have the truth of worship. Cain and Abel offered sacrifices to God, this means that they too did not have the truth. The true tabernacle in heaven does not require animal sacrifices [Heb 9:23-24]<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Peace with God [Col 1:19-20]<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
<li>The preaching of the Gospel [Mat 28:18-20]<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a>, if God does not send men to preach, there will be no preaching of the Gospel [Rom 10:14]<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a>
<ol>
<li>Before the alienation of men, the gospel was preached for the name of Yahweh was proclaimed [Gen 4:26]<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></li>
<li>God withdrew the gospel from Gentile nations, letting them go their own way [Act 14:16]<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></li>
<li>God did not withdraw the Gospel from the Jews. The Jews had the very words of God [Rom 3:1-2]<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a>, indeed, unlike the Gentiles the Jews had the word of God preached to them [Rom 10:14-18; Heb 4:1-2]<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Adoption of sons into God&rsquo;s family
<ol>
<li>The Jews were part of God&rsquo;s family, but were not sons, rather they were servants, e.g., Moses [Heb 2:5; Gal 4:1-2]<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a></li>
<li>The Gentiles were not a part of the family of God, they had been cut off</li>
<li>Before the alienation of men, starting with Adam, all men were God&rsquo;s people and there was no distinction between them</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The gift and presence of the Holy Spirit
<ol>
<li>He was present at the very start of creation [Gen 1:2] and continued to be with man; Adam had the Holy Spirit for how else could he have descriptively named the animals since he was not there when they were created? The prophets in Adam&rsquo;s family, Enoch, Lamech, Noah, etc. also confirm that the Holy Spirit was with men. God withdrew his Spirit from mankind [Gen 6:3]<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a> as he later on did from King Saul [1Sa 16:14]<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a>.</li>
<li>The Jews had the Holy Spirit among them [Isa 65:9-10; Hag 2:5]<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a></li>
<li>The Gentiles of course did not have the Holy Spirit but instead had demons. Nevertheless, alienating men did not mean that the Holy Spirit could not use a person temporarily; Pharaoh was a Gentile, but he received a dream from God concerning a decree He had made; Nebuchadnezzar received dreams from God one, describing all the kingdoms that will exist from his kingdom to the coming of the kingdom of God [Dan 2<em>(:36-45)</em>].</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Jesus said that the bread of the children&mdash;the people of God&mdash;should not be given to their dogs&mdash;the Gentiles and sinners [Mat 15:26]<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> and the gift of the Holy Spirit is part of the children&rsquo;s bread [Mat 7:9-11 <em>cf. </em>Luk 11:11-13; Act 2:38-39]<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>. This means that those who do not belong to God&rsquo;s family have no share in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>The Hope of Eternal life
<ol>
<li>This was always there, though Adam had been cut off from the Tree of Life, there was always a hope among the saints of God that God would one day give them relief from the curse upon the earth [Gen 5:29]<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> and that they would be free from death [Psa 49:7-9,]<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>.</li>
<li>This hope was always however tied to service, just as Adam only had this privilege at the beginning because he was employed in the service of God as a gardener. The Law which offers life does so on the condition of faithful obedience [Gal 3:12]<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>and even the New Covenant offers us eternal life only if we will faithfully serve the Lord Jesus Christ [Heb 5:9]<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>. Therefore, men, being cut off from God, meant that they could not serve him and could not reasonably hope for eternal life.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Justification by faith</li>
</ol>
<p>This is always possible as long as men know God and have faith in him, and there is no sin or judgment, such as is upon all men, standing in the way [Rom 4:6-7]<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a></p>
<ol>
<li>As we can see from the justification of Abraham, justification by faith was possible before alienation. To be justified by faith however, one must have faith which requires the knowledge of God and relationship with Him. Since men were in darkness and were ignorant of God, they couldn&rsquo;t have had faith and thus could not have been justified by faith.</li>
<li>The Jews had the word of God, but the challenge for them was on one hand, the Law, for it made them transgressors and as transgressors, they could not be justified [Gal 3:]. On the other hand, the influence of the powers of darkness meant that though they were in the light, they were blind to see, though they had and heard and read the word of God, it did not produce the required faith in them because of the influence of Satan [2Co 3:14-15; 4:4]<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>New Covenant
<ol>
<li>Men did not have the New Covenant before Christ came</li>
<li>Nevertheless, the most essential part of the New Covenant&mdash;we being God&rsquo;s people and God being our God&mdash;is not new but a restoration to what things were.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Made Gentiles God&rsquo;s people
<ol>
<li>All men were God&rsquo;s people before God alienated them preserving only the Jews as such. Through Christ, even the Gentiles can now be God&rsquo;s people [Eph 2:13]<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Deliverance from the principalities and powers
<ol>
<li>The principalities and powers have always had rule of our world and only in the age to come, the age of the kingdom of God, will this change [Heb 2:5]<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>. The rule of the angelic authorities is because man being mortal, flesh and blood, is lower than angels who are spirits [Heb 2:7<em>a</em>]<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>.
<ol>
<li>The principalities gained direct rule over us when God divided men into nations [Gen 11:7-8; Deu 32:7-9]<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a>. This action was well planned, and was not simply left to random forces for exact boundaries were predetermined [Act 17:26]<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>, and nations were placed under the &lsquo;sons of God&rsquo;[Deu 32:9 <em>cf. </em>Dan 10:13,20; 12:1 <em>where angelic princes of Persia, Greece and Israel are mentioned</em>].</li>
<li>The major problem was that, we were by the rejection of God confined to their rule, more or less, forever. The Law is what made our being under their rule permanent [Gal 3:23]<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> because it meant that we could not be glorified due to transgression.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Just as with King Saul [1Sa 16:14]<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>, and as Jesus taught [Mat 12:43-45]<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>, the vacuum created by the general withdrawal of the Holy Spirit from mankind, was filled up by evil spirits.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="14">
<li>The hope of glory
<ol>
<li>Man would eventually have been glorified. This we know for certain
<ol>
<li>From the mandate given him to subdue the earth, since it required it <em>(man&rsquo;s dominion of the world was not to be through science but by the power of the Spirit of God) </em>and</li>
<li>From the fact that Eden was a temple complex indicating that man was to eventually enter God&rsquo;s Most Holy Place which would have required glory.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Also, God plainly states that we were <em>(originally) </em>created for His glory</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Therefore, the hope of glory, which we now have in Christ Jesus, is a restoration of what once was.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li>Intercession</li>
<li>Our priesthood</li>
<li>Heavenly citizenship</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> [2Co 5:18-20] All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: <sub>19</sub>that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting men&rsquo;s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> [Heb 9:9] This is an illustration for the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper.</p>
<p>[Heb 10:1-4] The law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming&mdash;not the realities themselves. For this reason it can never, by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year, make perfect those who draw near to worship. <sub>2</sub>If it could, would they not have stopped being offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all, and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins. <sub>3</sub>But those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins, <sub>4</sub>because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> [Gal 3:12<em>b</em>,21<em>b</em>] <sub>19</sub>&hellip;&ldquo;The man who does these things will live by them.&rdquo;&nbsp; <sub>21</sub>&hellip;For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> [Rom 4:15] &hellip;because law brings wrath. And where there is no law there is no transgression.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref5" name="_ftn5">[5]</a> [Rom 7:10-11] I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. <sub>11</sub>For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref6" name="_ftn6">[6]</a> [Joh 1:17] For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref7" name="_ftn7">[7]</a> [Col 2:17] These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref8" name="_ftn8">[8]</a> [Heb 9:23-24] It was necessary, then, for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these. <sub>24</sub>For Christ did not enter a man-made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one; he entered heaven itself, now to appear for us in God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref9" name="_ftn9">[9]</a> [Col 1:19-20] For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, <sub>20</sub>and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref10" name="_ftn10">[10]</a> [Mat 28:18-20] Then Jesus came to them and said, &ldquo;All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. <sub>19</sub>Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <sub>20</sub>and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref11" name="_ftn11">[11]</a> [Rom 10:15] And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, &ldquo;How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref12" name="_ftn12">[12]</a> [Gen 4:26 YLT] And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he calleth his name Enos; <u>then a beginning was made of preaching in the name of Jehovah</u>.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref13" name="_ftn13">[13]</a> [Act 14:16] In the past, he let all nations go their own way.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref14" name="_ftn14">[14]</a> [Rom 3:1-2] What advantage, then, is there in being a Jew, or what value is there in circumcision? <sub>2</sub>Much in every way! First of all, they have been entrusted with the very words of God.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref15" name="_ftn15">[15]</a> [Rom 10:14-18] How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them? <sub>15</sub>And how can they preach unless they are sent? As it is written, &ldquo;How beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news!&rdquo; <sub>16</sub>But not all the Israelites accepted the good news. For Isaiah says, &ldquo;Lord, who has believed our message?&rdquo; <sub>17</sub>Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ. <sub>18</sub>But I ask: Did they not hear? Of course they did: &ldquo;Their voice has gone out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Heb 4:1-2] Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it. <sub>2</sub>For we also have had the gospel preached to us, just as they did; but the message they heard was of no value to them, because those who heard did not combine it with faith.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref16" name="_ftn16">[16]</a> [Heb 2:5] Moses was faithful as a servant in all God&rsquo;s house, testifying to what would be said in the future.</p>
<p>[Gal 4:1-2] What I am saying is that as long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a slave, although he owns the whole estate. <sub>2</sub>He is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref17" name="_ftn17">[17]</a>[Gen 6:3] Then the Lord said, &ldquo;My Spirit will not contend with man forever&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref18" name="_ftn18">[18]</a> [1Sa 16:14] Now the Spirit of the Lordhad departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref19" name="_ftn19">[19]</a> [Isa 63:10-14] Yet <u>they rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit</u>. So he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them. <sub>11</sub>Then his people recalled the days of old, the days of Moses and his people where is he who brought them through the sea, with the shepherd of his flock? Where is <u>he who set his Holy Spirit among them</u>, <sub>12</sub>who sent his glorious arm of power to be at Moses&rsquo; right hand, who divided the waters before them, to gain for himself everlasting renown, <sub>13</sub>who led them through the depths? Like a horse in open country, they did not stumble; <sub>14</sub>like cattle that go down to the plain, <u>they were given rest by the Spirit of the LORD</u>. This is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Hag 2:5] This is what I covenanted with you when you came out of Egypt. And <u>my Spirit remains among you</u>. Do not fear.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref20" name="_ftn20">[20]</a> [Mat 15:26] He replied, &ldquo;It is not right to take the children&rsquo;s bread and toss it to their dogs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref21" name="_ftn21">[21]</a> [Mat 7:9-11] Which of you, <u>if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone</u>? <sub>10</sub>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? <sub>11</sub>If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!</p>
<p>[Luk 11:11-13] If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>[Act 2:38-39] Peter replied, &ldquo;Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. <sub>39</sub>The promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off&mdash;for all whom the Lord our God will call.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref22" name="_ftn22">[22]</a> [Gen 5:29] He named him Noah and said, &ldquo;He will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the Lord has cursed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref23" name="_ftn23">[23]</a> [Psa 49:7-9,15] No man can redeem the life of another or give to God a ransom for him<sub>8</sub>the ransom for a life is costly, no payment is ever enough&mdash;<sub>9</sub>that he should live on forever and not see decay&hellip;<sub>15</sub>But God will redeem my life from the grave; he will surely take me to himself. Selah</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref24" name="_ftn24">[24]</a> [Gal 3:12] &ldquo;The man who does these things will live by them.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref25" name="_ftn25">[25]</a> [Heb 5:7-9] During the days of Jesus&rsquo; life on earth, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverent submission. <sub>8</sub>Although he was a son, he learned obedience from what he suffered <sub>9</sub>and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref26" name="_ftn26">[26]</a> [Rom 4:6-7] David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works: 7&ldquo;Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. 8Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will never count against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref27" name="_ftn27">[27]</a> [2Co 3:14-15] But their minds were made dull, for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read. It has not been removed, because only in Christ is it taken away. <sub>15</sub>Even to this day when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.</p>
<p>[2Co 4:4] The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref28" name="_ftn28">[28]</a> [Eph 2:13,19] But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of Christ.<sub>19</sub>Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and aliens, but fellow citizens with God&rsquo;s people and members of God&rsquo;s household,</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref29" name="_ftn29">[29]</a> [Heb 2:5] It is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come, about which we are speaking.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref30" name="_ftn30">[30]</a> [Heb 2:7<em>a</em>] You made him a little lower than the angels&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref31" name="_ftn31">[31]</a>[Gen 11:7-8] &ldquo;Come, let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other.&rdquo; <sub>8</sub>So the LORD scattered them from there over all the earth, and they stopped building the city.</p>
<p>[Deu 32:7-9] Remember the days of old; consider the generations long past. Ask your father and he will tell you, your elders, and they will explain to you. <sub>8</sub>When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance, when he divided all mankind, he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of <em>God</em>. <sub>9</sub>For the LORD&rsquo;s portion is his people, Jacob his allotted inheritance.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref32" name="_ftn32">[32]</a> From one man he made every nation of men, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref33" name="_ftn33">[33]</a> [Gal 3:23] Before this faith came, we were held prisoners by the law, locked up until faith should be revealed.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref34" name="_ftn34">[34]</a> [1Sa 16:14] Now the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented him.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref35" name="_ftn35">[35]</a> [Mat 12:43-45] When an evil spirit comes out of a man, it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it. <sub>44</sub>Then it says, &lsquo;I will return to the house I left.&rsquo; <u>When it arrives, it finds the house unoccupied</u>, swept clean and put in order. <sub>45</sub>Then <u>it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself, and they go in and live there</u>. And the final condition of that man is worse than the first. That is how it will be with this wicked generation.</p>
