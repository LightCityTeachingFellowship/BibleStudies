<h1><a name="_Toc429946294"></a>The World in Darkness<a name="_Toc431095287"></a>&mdash;Examples of Rejection (Part 1)</h1>
</header>
<h1><a name="_Toc431096673"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>Every relationship has benefits it offers its members, and along with these benefits come duties. When God rejects a person, it does not mean that God has totally ceased to relate with such a person in every form, nor does it mean that such a one has been cut off from every form of blessing from God. No. The fact is that, nothing can change the basic fact that God is God of all&mdash;for he created all things and they are sustained by his will [Rev 4:11]<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>. The fact is that it is practically impossible to stop relating with God in an absolute sense because his presence is everywhere [Act 17:27-28]<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>. Again God takes care of all creation, including those who are disobedient to him and will not serve him as they ought to and those who hate him [Act 14:16-17; Mat 2:44-45]<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a> and everything a man has comes from God [1Co 4:7; Jam 1:17]<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> so how can we cease to relate with God and God with us?</p>
<p>Therefore, God&rsquo;s rejection of the world, which plunged it into darkness must be understood as a relative or partial and not as absolute, sincethis is practically impossible. We must understand it in terms of specific benefits men are cut off from which God now, through Christ and his atonement restores to man if he will submit to Christ&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>The following are examples from scripture which illustrate that alienation by or from God does not imply an absolute or near absolute break in relations. These examples also demonstrate some aspects of God&rsquo;s rejection of men from himself&mdash;how, why and the consequences. As you consider these examples, try to define these relationships&mdash;broken and restored&mdash;in concretely and practically in terms of their obligations, duties, benefits, rights and privileges.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc431096674"></a><a name="_Toc431095288"></a>God and Adam&mdash;Driving Adam out of the Garden</h1>
<p>Adam was the first and only man to be created by God and after God had created him, God placed him in the Garden of Eden which He (God) had planted. God put Adam in this garden as the gardener and protector of the garden offering Adam shelter and sustenance (food) as his reward. In this garden however, there were two trees of great value which possessed divine qualities, one, of wisdom (the ability to discern good from evil) and the second, eternal life. God prohibited man from eating of the tree of knowledge, &ldquo;You must not eat of the tree of knowledge&rdquo; and the consequence for disobedience was certain death, &ldquo;In the day you eat of it, you will surely die!&rdquo; Sadly, Adam disobeyed God and the threatened consequence followed.</p>
<p>God cursed the ground and thus subjected Adam to aging and decay. And on account of his disobedience, God drove him out of the Garden of Eden, &ldquo;lest he take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever.&rdquo; [Gen 3:22]. Not only did God drive him out of the Garden of Eden, but God ensured that Adam and in fact no man could by any means reenter the Garden of Eden and eat of the tree of life. Thus, God ensured that no man could ever gain eternal life contrary to his judgment against Adam.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,as is evident in the story of Cain and Abel, Adam and his family still lived in Eden and still had fellowship with God. (The Garden of Eden was only a part of the land called Eden.) And as we can see from Cain&rsquo;s complaint, Adam and his family, in Eden <em>(not the Garden of Eden)</em> were living under God&rsquo;s protection.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096675"></a><a name="_Toc431095289"></a>What Changed with Adam&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adam lost access to the tree of life [Gen 3:22]<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a></li>
<li>On account of the tree of life in the Garden, Adam lost access to the Garden of Eden [Gen 3:23-24]<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a> and along with it, all the benefits of the garden. Now he had to work really hard to eat.</li>
<li>Fulfilling the command to subdue and replenish the earth [Gen 1:28]<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7">[7]</a> became much harder because Adam now had to contend against the curse on the ground [Gen 3:17<em>c</em>-19<em>a</em>]<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8">[8]</a>.</li>
<li>Fulfilling the command to increase became much harder because Eve was going to give birth through greater pain [Gen 3:16]<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096676"></a><a name="_Toc431095290"></a>What Remained the Same In Spite of Adam&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adam and his family still had fellowship with God and worshiped him as is evident from Cain and Abel&rsquo;s story</li>
<li>God stilled cared for them as even after judging them, he clothed them [Gen 3:21]<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10">[10]</a></li>
<li>Though no more in the Garden, Adam and his family were still living in Eden, in God&rsquo;s presence and under God&rsquo;s protection [Gen 4:14-16]<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11">[11]</a></li>
<li>God&rsquo;s command and blessing upon mankind to increase and multiply and replenish the earth and to have dominion over all earthly creatures remained unchanged [Gen 1:28 Psa 8:6-8]<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12">[12]</a></li>
<li>Adam and his family were still servants of God as they were still to replenish the earth and subdue it though both tasks had been made difficult.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096677"></a>Relevant Lessons</h2>
<p>We can see that what Adam lost was the relationship he had with God as his gardener but not the one he had with him as his servant in ruling over the earth. There can be more than one relationship existing between God and a man/men and that one is broken does not mean that all others are as well.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc431096678"></a><a name="_Toc431095291"></a>God and Cain&mdash;Driving Cain from Eden</h1>
<p>Cain, Adam&rsquo;s son, killed his brother Abel because he was favoured by God above him. At this time however, there was no express prohibition against murder and so Cain was not killed by God for his horrible act. Instead, God drove Cain away from Eden which Cain had defiled with the blood of his brother Abel which was crying out for vengeance against him.</p>
<p>A fact we may note is that, though what Cain did was one of the most terrible sins one could ever commit, he was not killed because there was at this time no express command against murder. We may also note that sin is punishable even when it is not an express command that has been broken.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096679"></a><a name="_Toc431095292"></a>What Changed with Cain&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cain was driven away from God&rsquo;s presence [Gen 4:14]<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13">[13]</a></li>
<li>Cain could no longer fulfill the mandate of subduing the earth [Gen 4:12]<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14">[14]</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096680"></a><a name="_Toc431095293"></a>What Remained the Same In Spite of Cain&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cain was given a form of protection by God [Gen 4:15]<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15">[15]</a></li>
<li>Cain was still alive</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096681"></a>Relevant Lessons</h2>
<p>Cain lost part of the essential relationship every man has with God established at creation&mdash;he could not subdue the earth. From the fact that Cain was rejected alone and Adam wasn&rsquo;t rejected along with him, we can see that men can have different levels of rejection&mdash;though both Jews and Gentiles needed reconciliation, the Jews were near but the Gentiles were far away. Just as all men after Adam shared in his fate, so too, Cain&rsquo;s wife and children shared in his fate. This tells us that alienating men does not require every single man to be personally guilty.<a name="_Toc431095294"></a></p>
<h1><a name="_Toc431096682"></a>God and King Saul&mdash;The Rejection of King Saul</h1>
<p>Saul was anointed king of Israel by the prophet Samuel. Saul received the Holy Spirit after his anointing as king of Israel [1Sa 10:6]<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16">[16]</a>. Now Saul was given certain instructions at the time of his call, one of which was that he was to wait for Samuel to come and offer sacrifices before engaging in a certain war [1Sa 10:7-8]<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17">[17]</a>. King Saul failed to keep this instruction however [1Sa 13:7-9]<a href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18">[18]</a> and God punished him for this by not establishing his throne [1Sa 13:13-14]<a href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19">[19]</a> forever over Israel, i.e., his children were not going to be king after him. Nevertheless Saul was still king of Israel and God was still with him in this office.</p>
<p>Sometime after this, Saul was given another instruction by Yahweh to destroy completely his enemies the Amalekites [1Sa 15:2-3<em>a</em>]<a href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20">[20]</a> and King Saul once again offended. King Saul was to destroy every living thing in Amalek but instead left the best animals and the king of Amalek alive [1Sa 15:20-21]<a href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21">[21]</a>. For this God rejected him as king over Israel [1sa 15:26]<a href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22">[22]</a> and took away his Holy Spirit which he had been given following his appointment as king over Israel. Though he was still king of Israel, God was no longer with him and no longer spoke to him again by any means&mdash;priest, prophets or dreams [1Sa 28:6]<a href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23">[23]</a>. Now, not only was the Spirit taken from him but an evil spirit from God began to trouble him [1Sa 16:14]<a href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24">[24]</a>.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096683"></a><a name="_Toc431095295"></a>What Changed with King Saul&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>King Saul lost continuity, a type of eternal life&mdash;the throne of Israel was not to remain in his family forever</li>
<li>He lost the chance he had to establish his throne over Israel forever</li>
<li>King Saul lost the Holy Spirit and got an evil spirit instead</li>
<li>God no longer communicated with King Saul even when king Saul called on him</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096684"></a><a name="_Toc431095296"></a>What Remained the Same In Spite of King Saul&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Though God had rejected him, Saul was still Yahweh&rsquo;s anointed and nothing could change the fact. Though Saul sought to kill David without cause, David was careful not to raise a hand against him because of this fact for it would surely be an offence against God [1Sa 24:10; 26:10]<a href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25">[25]</a>.</li>
<li>Saul remained king of Israel till he died</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431096685"></a>Relevant Lessons</h2>
<p>Saul&rsquo;s rejection was in two stages, first, King Saul lost continuity of the monarchy, his kingdom was not be established forever. Second, King Saul was cut off from God&rsquo;s presence; God ceased to communicate with him and withdrew his Spirit from him.We may note a similar pattern in the rejection of King Saul and man&rsquo;s rejection from Adam to Cain.</p>
<p>Like Adam lost the chance to gain eternal life and was not going to live forever, so too Saul lost the chance to gain eternal life for his throne&mdash;it was not going to be established forever. Nevertheless, Adam lived in Eden, God&rsquo;s presence and in, the same way, God was still with King Saul.</p>
<p>The rejection that followed that of Adam was that of Cain and it is much like Saul&rsquo;s second rejection. Cain was driven from God&rsquo;s presence which was a worsening of the situation brought on by Adam&rsquo;s transgression <em>(i.e., sin)</em>. In the same way, the second time Saul was rejected matters became worse because God withdrew his Spirit from him and would no longer speak to him.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc431635924"></a>Samson</h1>
<p>Samson was consecrated to God as a Nazirite from conception and he was to remain so for life [Jdg 13:3-5]<a href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26">[26]</a>. Although there were other prohibitions that came along with this consecration [Jdg 13:4], it primarily meant that Samson was never to cut the hair on his head. It was as though he was in a covenant with God as long as he did not cut the hair on his head.</p>
<p>Samson was filled with the Spirit [Jdg 13:24-25]<a href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27">[27]</a> and was gifted with extraordinary strength by the Spirit of God upon him. The Spirit of God would not forsake Samson on any account even when,against the Nazirite regulations, he just ate honey from a dead lion [Jdg 14:8-9]<a href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28">[28]</a>. Samson&rsquo;s enemies, the Philistines, whom Samson on several occasions had singlehandedly humiliated sought ways to disarm Samson and sadly they succeeded.</p>
<p>Samson quite foolishly revealed the source of his strength to his enemies who wasted no time in cutting off his hair while he was asleep [Jdg 16:19]<a href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29">[29]</a>. Once his hair was cut, the result of his wayward lifestyle, his consecration to God as a Nazirite was broken, his strength left him and he became as weak as any other man. Samson however did not realized that Yahweh <em>(the Spirit)</em> had departed from him until he was so easily overpowered and captured by his enemies the Philistines [Jdg 16:20]<a href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30">[30]</a>. His enemies quickly put out both his eyes and made him a prisoner employed in slave labour [Jdg 16:21]<a href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31">[31]</a> and entertainment [Jdg 16:25]<a href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32">[32]</a>.</p>
<p>The Philistines naturally wanting to humiliate their terrible foe, left their blind slave unkempt and with time Samson&rsquo;s hair grew [Jdg 16:22]<a href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33">[33]</a> which meant that he could be restored to his consecration to God. Samson called on God who restored his supernatural strength to him, his eyes were however still blind and he needed the aid of someone to use his strength against his enemies.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635925"></a>What Changed with Samson&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The LORD <em>(the Spirit of God)</em> departed from him</li>
<li>He lost his extraordinary strength and was overpowered by his enemies</li>
<li>He became a slave to the enemies of Israel</li>
<li>He was made blind by his enemies</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635926"></a>What Remained the Same In Spite of Samson&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Samson could still call on God</li>
<li>His hair consecrated him to God</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635927"></a>Relevant Lessons</h2>
<p>The fact that Samson&rsquo;s Nazirite relationship to God was restored once his hair was restored highlights a very important fact and that is that every relationship is established upon certain conditions. The relationship is broken if the condition upon which it is built is destroyed and can be restored anytime the condition is restored, if it is one that can be restored.</p>
<p>Also, we can see from Samson&rsquo;s story that even when the condition upon which a broken relationship was built is restored, it does not mean that the broken relationship will be automatically restored. Though Samson&rsquo;s hair had grown back, he still had to pray to God before his strength could be restored to him [Jdg 16:28]<a href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34">[34]</a>.</p>
<p>As we can see from Samson&rsquo;s story, no sin, except it destroys or limits the basis of the relationship,is by itself sufficient to bring about estrangement.</p>
<h1><a name="_Toc431635928"></a>The Rejection of Israel and Judah</h1>
<p>The people and nation of Israel had a special covenant with God by which God alone was to be their God and they were to be God&rsquo;s people [Gen 17:7]<a href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35">[35]</a>. This meant that Israel was to worship Yahweh alone and never an idol or any other god [Exo 20:2-5<em>a</em>]<a href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36">[36]</a>. Not only was Israel to worship Yahweh, but they were to worship him in the way he prescribed. They were also to live righteously and in holiness among the other nations testifying of God&rsquo;s righteous and holy character to the other nations around them.</p>
<p>Israel as a people wastruly blessed of God and were indeed unlike other nations. God gave them his Spirit, spoke with them through his prophets of which they had many, gave them priests and expressly made his will known to them through the Law.</p>
<p>Israel however sinned so many times against God and did not observe their consecration to him and though God often punished them, he never rejected them as his people, he never withdrew from them those special privileges that made them different from others. Nevertheless, after much repeated offences against him, God dealt the severest of blows on his people and rejected them.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635929"></a>Two Nations</h2>
<p>Sometime in its history, God split the nation of Israel in two&mdash;Israel and Judah&mdash;[1Ki 11:30-32]<a href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37">[37]</a> along preexisting geopolitical fault lines. He did this basically to reduce the dominion of Solomon and thus punish him. This split meant that each half had a different history in its relationship to God and so, though both nations were eventually rejected by God for their rebellion, the details of their rejections are not the same.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635930"></a>Rejecting Israel</h2>
<p>Israel in the north was the first to pervert the worship of God, first, by worshiping him contrary to the stipulated regulations of the Law of Moses&mdash;they worshiped Yahweh God through images, in temples of their own design, locations of their own choosing [Deu 12:5-6]<a href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38">[38]</a> and used priests who were not Levites [1Ki 11:28-33]<a href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39">[39]</a>. This was bad enough but they went further still, worshiping the gods of the surrounding nations [1Ki 17:7-20]. For this, God rejected Israel completely exiling them by the hand of the Assyrian king from his land, the land of Israel [2Ki 18:9-12]<a href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40">[40]</a>. They became foreigners in foreign lands and the king of Assyria ensured that they could not return to their land by settling other peoples in the land.</p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635931"></a>Rejecting Judah</h2>
<p>While Israel went astray, Judah remained faithful to God and so remained in God&rsquo;s favour much longer. Nevertheless, Judah too fell into the terrible sins of idolatry and bloodshed and broke God&rsquo;s Law at many points. The Sabbath, which was the sign of the Old Covenant between God and Israel [Exo 31:13]<a href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41">[41]</a> was desecrated, thus breaking the Covenant, they even desecrated the temple of God by offering unclean animals upon the altar, worshiping idols and other gods in it. For all of this, God rejected them.</p>
<p>Like Israel in the north, Judah too was exiled&mdash;they were exiled to Babylon. At this point, the rejection of Israel and Judah is similar but Judah&rsquo;s rejection involved even more because of the greater favor she had enjoyed from God. Of all the towns and cities of Israel, God had chosen Jerusalem and Zion[Psa 87:1-2; 132:13-14]<a href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42">[42]</a> which were in Judah, and in Jerusalem was God&rsquo;s earthly temple. In Judah also reigned the kings from David&rsquo;s line. Judah upon exile lost all of this&mdash;God destroyed his temple which was in Jerusalem and put an end to the reign of kings in Judah.</p>
<p>The exile of Israel and Judah is described as casting them out of God&rsquo;s presence [Jer 23:39]<a href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43">[43]</a></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635932"></a>What Remained the Same In Spite of Israel and Judah&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ol>
<li>They were Abraham, Isaac and Jacob&rsquo;s descendants</li>
<li>God still cared for them even in exile [Eze 11:16]<a href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44">[44]</a></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They were still to worship God [Deu 4:26-29]<a href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45">[45]</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>What Changed with Israel and Judah&rsquo;s Rejection?</h2>
<ol>
<li>They were cast out of God&rsquo;s presence</li>
<li>They lost possession of the land of promise</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>They were foreigners in foreign lands</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The became subject to other powers [2Ki 25:24; Jer 5:19]<a href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46">[46]</a> and foreign gods as God had long warned them [Deu 28:36; Jer 16:13]<a href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47">[47]</a>&mdash;since they will not serve Him, he gave them over to serve others to see the difference [2Ch 12:8]<a href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48">[48]</a>.</li>
<li>Their minds and hearts were cursed&mdash;they were made spiritually blind and deaf, so that they are unable to truly understand the things of God [Isa 6:9]<a href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49">[49]</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>This stops them from being fully restored to God and from being saved [Isa 6:10<em>b</em>]<a href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50">[50]</a>. This is why they could not recognize Christ when he came and murdered the very one they had for so long been waiting for.This aspect of their rejection has not been overturned but is still in effect and is to continue till the second coming of Christ. This is a punishment for them, a retribution for their sins [Rom 11:7-10]<a href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51">[51]</a>.</p>
<p>For this reason, though Israel is so blessed and unlike other nations has the light of God&mdash;the Law of Moses and his words to them through his prophets&mdash;they are in the dark having been made blind [1Co 3:14-15; 4:3-4]<a href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52">[52]</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The spiritual institutions were weakened</li>
</ol>
<p>This darkness was partly accomplished by weakening the spiritual and religious offices that promoted the will and ways of God among the people. The prophetic ministry was greatly affected, the prophets who were the spiritual eyes of the people became blind, they no longer received visions from the LORD, they inquired but there were no answers [Isa 29:9-10;Mic 3:6]<a href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53">[53]</a>. Priests and pastors who were the teachers and leaders of the people failed in their office and could not properly understand the word of the LORD [Isa 29:11-12<a href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54">[54]</a><em>cf.</em> Rom 11:9-10]. This was however not absolute for there were still prophets among the people, however they became more and more few till they became such a rare occurrence among the people.</p>
<ol>
<li>God gave them a spirit of deep sleep [Isa 29:9-12]<a href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55">[55]</a></li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>God&rsquo;s glory departed from the temple [Eze 8:6; 10]<a href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56">[56]</a> and his temple was destroyed</li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635934"></a>Relevant Lessons</h2>
<p>As we read through scriptures, we can see that not all who suffered along with Israel and Judah were personally guilty; some of these men and women were extremely pious and faithful to God and to his Law. Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel and others like them suffered along with Israelin her rejection but were certainly not personally guilty of the sins for which God rejected Israel.</p>
<h2>The Spirit in Israel&rsquo;s Story</h2>
<p>God did not reject any of both nations without warning but over and over again, he warned them [1Ki 17:13-14]<a href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57">[57]</a> through the prophets by his Holy Spirit in them but they were rebellious and rejected the Holy Spirit [Neh 9:30]<a href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58">[58]</a>. The consequence was that the he turned and became their enemy [Isa 63:10; Act 7:51]<a href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59">[59]</a>. So the Israelites had the Spirit of God among them [Neh 9:20;Isa 63:11-14]<a href="#_ftn60" name="_ftnref60">[60]</a></p>
<h2><a name="_Toc431635933"></a>Judah&rsquo;s Return from Exile</h2>
<p>Judah&rsquo;s exile lasted seventy years after which they were restored to the land. God nevertheless has not fully restored them for their return to the land was only partial. The seventy year exile of Judah particularly atoned for one sin&mdash;the desecration of the Sabbath [2Chr 36:19-21 <em>cf. </em>Lev 25:1-5; 26:32-35]<a href="#_ftn61" name="_ftnref61">[61]</a>. It did not cater to other sins such as the blood that had been shed [2Ki 24:3-4]<a href="#_ftn62" name="_ftnref62">[62]</a> which cannot be easily atoned for but by the blood of the one who shed it [Joe 3:21 <em>cf.</em> Num 35:33-34]<a href="#_ftn63" name="_ftnref63">[63]</a>; they were still paying for these bloods even long after Jesus&rsquo; atonement [Mat 23:35-38]<a href="#_ftn64" name="_ftnref64"></a>.</p>
