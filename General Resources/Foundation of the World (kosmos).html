<header><h3>When The Foundation of the World<em> (kosmos)</em> Was Laid</h3>
<p>The laying of the foundation of the world <em>(kosmos)</em> lasted from the creation of light up to the division of nations.</p></header>
<ol>
<li>Starting with the beginning of creation [Joh 17:5<em> cf., </em>Joh 1:1-3; Gen 1]</li>
<li>Including the seven days of creation [Gen 1; Heb 4:3]</li>
<li>including the time of Adam&rsquo;s transgression when sin entered the world [Heb 9:26<em> there would have been no need for the atonement if sin had not entered the world&mdash;sin entered the world through Adam&rsquo;s transgression </em><em>Rom 5:12</em><em>. Jesus would have had to die many times since the laying of the foundation of the world</em>]</li>
<li>Up to the time of the death of Abel <em>(since he was the first martyr) </em>at the hands of Cain [Luk 11:50-51]</li>
<li>Up to the division of men into nations. In Dan 12:1 we read of <em>&ldquo;the beginning of nations&rdquo;</em> but in Mat 24:21 we read of <em>&ldquo;the beginning of the world (i.e., kosmos)&rdquo;</em>. The beginning of the world <em>(kosmos) </em>clearly includes the beginning of nations.</li>
