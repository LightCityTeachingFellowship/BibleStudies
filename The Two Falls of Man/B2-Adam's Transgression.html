    <h1>Adam's Transgression</h1>    
	<!--excerpt.start-->
    <p>Below is a brief exploration of the state of things when God created the world.</p>
</header>

<h1>What Happened</h1>
<!--excerpt.end-->
<ol>
	<li>Adam <em>(and Eve)</em> transgressed God&rsquo;s command not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil</li>
	<li>They acquired the knowledge of good and evil</li>
	<li>They were judged by God who cursed creation as a whole subjecting it to corruption</li>
	<li>They were driven out of the Garden of Eden and were not allowed back in.</li>
	<ol>
		<li>God ensured they could not reenter the Garden of Eden by placing cherubim on the east side of the Garden and</li>
		<li>God also ensured that no one could get them fruit from the Tree of Life by placing a fiery sword, flashing back and forth to guard the way to the Tree of Life.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>God drove man out of the Garden and made return impossible so that God and His justice would not be mocked. God said man would die but the Garden had a Tree whose fruit could impart eternal to him, if man ever ate of this Tree and, rather than die, lived for ever, God would become an object of mockery. (God will not allow himself to be mocked.)</li>
</ol>
<h1>Man&rsquo;s Relationship with God</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Man was still under preincarnate Christ and</li>
	<li>Was still God&rsquo;s son and people</li>
	<li>However, his relationship with God gained a limitation as he could not enter the Garden of Eden, the Holy Place</li>
	<li>Nevertheless, man continued to live in the land of Eden, in the presence of God, as His son and people. That is, man was living in the courtyard of the Tabernacle of God</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Resultant Sate of Things</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Man has the knowledge of good and evil</li>
	<li>By the Judgement that followed his transgression</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Man and Creation come under condemnation (the curse of death)&mdash;the Devil&rsquo;s power,&mdash;the world came under the power of the devil</li>
		<li>Man is driven out of the Garden of Eden/Holy Place into Eden/the Courtyard<br />(He is driven out of the Garden because of the blessing there which he had become<br /> disqualified to possess. Nevertheless, man was still in God&rsquo;s presence and still under Christ).</li>
		<li>Re-entering the Garden was made impossible by the Cherubim guarding the entrance to the<br /> Garden and the flaming sword guarding the way to the Tree of Life.</li>
	</ol>
	<li>The dichotomy between clean and unclean animals began. This is really the result of the curse of corruption</li>
	<ol>
		<li>However, since God, at this time, had not permitted man to eat meat, this dichotomy only mattered for sacrifices to God</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Man needs</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Eternal life (and freedom from condemnation) to re-enter the Holy Place, and</li>
		<li>The Glory of God to enter the Most Holy Place (man was created for glory)</li>
	</ol>
</ol>
<h1>Blessings Man Still Has</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Man still retains all the initial blessings of his creation&mdash;</li>
	<ol>
		<li>The natural image of God</li>
		<li>The blessing of being lord of the earth (though now it is rivaled by Satan's corruption/death authority)</li>
		<li>The right to eat plants</li>
	</ol>
	<li>Man still has the Holy Spirit [Gen 6:3]</li>
	<li>Man is still dwelling in the Presence of God [Gen 4:14,16].</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Though he had been driven out of the Garden of Eden, man was still living in the land of Eden which is equivalent to the courtyard of the tabernacle. The courtyard is where the altar of burnt offering was and where burnt offerings were offered to Yahweh.</li>
	</ol>
