    <h1>Creation</h1>
	<!--excerpt.start-->
    <p>Below is a brief exploration of the state of things when God created the world.</p>
</header>
<h1>What Happened</h1>
<ol>
    <li>God, through Christ, created man in His image and likeness,</li>
	<li>Gave him dominion over all things, and</li>
	<li>Brought him into the Garden of Eden to work and keep it</li>
</ol>
<!--excerpt.end-->
<blockquote>
				<h1>Eden &amp; the Garden of Eden</h1>
				<!-- <ul> -->
					<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Land and Garden of Eden was God&rsquo;s tabernacle on earth, His first dwelling place
						<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
							<div>* The Garden of Eden was in the land of Eden. It was the Holy Place</div>
							<div>* The Land of Eden around and outside the Garden of Eden was the courtyard. And as under the tabernacle of Moses, it was here that sacrifices were offered as we read of Cain and Abel doing.</div>
						</div>
					</p>
					<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">The Eden Temple or Tabernacle was for all mankind
						<div style="margin-left: 2em;">
							<div>* There was no Jew/Gentile distinction</div>
							<div>* There was however a Seth/Cain distinction</div>
						</div>
					</p>

<h1>Man&rsquo;s Relationship to God</h1>
<ol>
	<li>All Men are by Creation God&rsquo;s Children/People <em>(through Christ)</em>
		<ol>
			<li>They were created by God</li>
			<li>They were created in the image and likeness of God</li>
			<li>Man was appointed heir of all things from the start <em>(he only needed to be glorified to realize his calling)</em></li>
			<li>By creation, all men are under Preincarnate Christ who is
				<ol>
					<li>The One through whom God created man and the world,</li>
					<li>God&rsquo;s Right Hand and Representative,</li>
					<li>The Radiance of God&rsquo;s Glory,</li>
					<li>The Exact Representation of God&rsquo;s Being,</li>
					<li>The Judge of All the Earth.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Man was a servant of God</li>
	<li>Man dwelled in the Garden of Eden which was at that time the Holy Place.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The Resultant State of Things</h1>
<ol>
	<li>By creation, man did not have
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Eternal life</strong><em> (This could only be gained on the condition of faithful and obedient service to God. This is apparent, from the fact that the Tree of Life was only present in the Garden of Eden and man only entered the Garden as a servant.)</em></li>
			<li>The <strong>Nature &amp; Glory of God </strong><em>(he was created mortal, of the dust of the ground)</em>, and</li>
			<li><strong>Access into Heaven</strong>, the &ldquo;Holy of Holies&rdquo;, the very Presence of God, <em>(the Garden of Eden<br /> is equivalent to the Holy Place and not to the Holy of Holies)</em>.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Man was to be glorified for he requires glory to fulfil the purpose of his creation which is to rule over creation.</li>
	<li>The fact that he was created in God&rsquo;s image and likeness made conformity to the image of Christ, the Son of God, possible</li>
	<li>Man was in a direct relationship with preincarnate Christ</li>
	<li>Man needs
		<ol>
			<li>The <strong>Glory of God </strong>to enter the Most Holy Place <em>(man was created for glory)</em></li>
			<li><strong><em>Eternal Life</em></strong></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
