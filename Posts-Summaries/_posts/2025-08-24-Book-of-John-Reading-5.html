<ol>
    <li>The Jews asked Jesus to tell them plainly that He&rsquo;s the Christ [<em>Joh 10:24-25</em>]. Many Christians are this way today. They want you to show them explicit verses where certain doctrines are plainly stated.<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus responded telling them that He had told them. He didn&rsquo;t explicitly say them, but through His miracles and statements. The Jews just refused to draw conclusions from what was obvious to them.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>What do the Jews mean when they say &ldquo;because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God&rdquo; [<em>Joh 10:33</em>]?
        <ol>
            <li>In Jesus&rsquo; response to them saying He makes Himself God, He rephrased their objection to mean &ldquo;the Son of God&rdquo;. Jesus&rsquo; reword would thus render their question; &ldquo;because that thou, being a man, makest thyself <strong>the Son of God</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>This was clearly what they meant when they said, &ldquo;you make yourself God&rdquo;. They didn&rsquo;t think He was claiming to be God the Father.</li>
            <li>A son of God&mdash;as Jesus was claiming&mdash;is God.
                <ol>
                    <li>Jesus clearly distinguished Himself from the Father</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The problem they had with Jesus&rsquo; claim of being God&rsquo;s Son is that He was a man.</li>
            <li>The Jews didn&rsquo;t say no one can be equal to God, showing that it is possible for someone other than the Father to claim to be God, but that person can&rsquo;t be a man.</li>
            <li>We can deduce that they believed that there was someone&mdash;at the very least&mdash;an angel who was equal to God.</li>
            <li>This reasoning isn&rsquo;t Jewish superstition, or wrong theology, rather, it is followed by the apostles&mdash;a man cannot be God&mdash;and is also taught by God Himself.
                <ol>
                    <li>John doesn&rsquo;t condemn or correct the Jews, and neither did Jesus.</li>
                    <li>Peter, Paul and Barnabas believed the same [<em>Acts 10:25-26; 14:15</em>]</li>
                    <li>God also confirms [<em>Isa 31:3</em>]</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The Jews weren&rsquo;t rejecting Jesus&rsquo; claim to Godhood because of His appearance.
                <ol>
                    <li>Jews knew angels can appear as men [<em>Gen 18; 19; Jgd 13:3, 6, 8-10</em>].</li>
                    <li>They knew with certainty that Jesus was a man because according to them, they knew His father and mother [<em>Joh 6:42</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus wasn&rsquo;t afraid of death, because He has the light of life in Him [<em>Joh 11:9-10</em>].</li>
            <li>Martha was saying to Jesus, that even though he didn&rsquo;t heal Lazarus, she still believed in Him [<em>Joh 11:21-22</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>She wasn&rsquo;t saying she knew God would bring Lazarus back to life if Jesus asked, because she didn&rsquo;t believe Jesus could raise Lazarus, and said He would rise at the last day [<em>Joh 11:23-24</em>].</li>
                </ol>
