<header><h1>Book of John (Reading & Study 6)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>The Kosmos (the world), and where the Father is are different places. Where the Father dwells isn&rsquo;t a part of the world [<em>Joh 13:1</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus is greater than us all. If He can stoop to serve us, then all Christians should be willing to serve fellow believers [<em>Joh 13:16</em>].<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>To be too proud to serve the faithful is to claim to be greater than Jesus.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>&ldquo;&hellip;You will believe that I am <em>he</em>&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t Jesus&rsquo; claim to equality to the Father, but a claim to be the Son of God [<em>Joh 13:19; 8:24</em>].</li>
    <li>To reject those sent by God is to reject God [<em>Joh 13:20</em>].</li>
    <li>Knowing that something is going to happen doesn&rsquo;t mean God doesn&rsquo;t feel the present [<em>Joh 13:21</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This answers questions like &ldquo;why did God regret creating man, when He knew man would fall?&rdquo;</li>
            <li>Jesus knew He would rise from the dead&mdash;He prophesied it many times, yet He prayed fervently in the garden, hoping the cup would pass over.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus wasn&rsquo;t only speaking to Judas when He said, &ldquo;what you&rsquo;re about to do, do quickly&rdquo;. He was also talking to the devil who entered Jesus [<em>Joh 13:27-28</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus answered Judas according to the idol in his heart.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus used to give to the poor [<em>Joh 13:29</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>If it wasn&rsquo;t something He did frequently, His disciples wouldn&rsquo;t think that was what He meant when He said Judas &ldquo;what you&rsquo;re about to do, do quickly&rdquo;.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus speaks in response to situations
        <ol>
            <li>He said it was time for Him to be glorified, and God to be glorified in Him. He said it after Judas had left to betray Him [<em>Joh 13:31</em>].</li>
            <li>When the Greeks asked to speak to Him, He said &ldquo;if I am lifted up, all men will be drawn to me&rdquo;</li>
            <li>When the disciples came back with a good report of demons being subject to His name, He said &ldquo;I beheld Satan fall like lightning&rdquo;.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>You can give God glory by praising Him, but He&rsquo;s also given glory by actions, by obeying His commands.</li>
    <li>God glorifying Jesus straightaway, refers to God taking Him (Jesus) to be with Him (God) in heaven [<em>Joh 13:32; 17:4-5</em>].</li>
    <li>When Jesus said, &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t follow me where I go&rdquo;, He was speaking not of His death&mdash;as the disciples could kill themselves to follow Him&mdash;but He was speaking of going to heaven.</li>
    <li>Jesus told them to not be troubled, because troubling events were about to take place [<em>Joh 14:1</em>].</li>
    <li>&ldquo;No one can come to the Father except through me&rdquo; refers to literally going to be with the Father in heaven and not just praying to the Father through Jesus [<em>Joh 14:6</em>].</li>
    <li>There were reasons other than miracles to believe in Jesus. His wisdom and John&rsquo;s testimony are also reasons to believe in Him [<em>Joh 14:11</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus in glory (in heaven) still prays. He will pray to God to give us His Spirit [<em>Joh 14:16</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus said God will give &ldquo;<strong>another</strong>&rdquo; comforter. This means there was a previous comforter. Obviously, Jesus Himself was the comforter.</li>
            <li>The duty of the comforter isn&rsquo;t to &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; in the modern sense i.e., to soothe distress by offering reassurance, ease, or emotional relief, typically aimed at reducing immediate pain or anxiety, but to stand as one in God&rsquo;s
                stead&mdash;a representative.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>&ldquo;&hellip;because I live, ye shall live also&rdquo; [<em>Joh 14:19</em>] refers to our living after His return, when we have been glorified.
        <ol>
            <li>This is apparent in Jesus&rsquo; next words &ldquo;On that day you will realize that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you [<em>Joh 14:20</em>]&rdquo;.</li>
            <li>On that day obviously refers to when Jesus returns and we have been glorified. When we see Jesus&rsquo; words come to pass, we will indeed realize that He is in the Father, and we are in Him, and He in us.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus will only reveal Himself to those who love Him and keep His word [<em>Joh 14:23-24</em>].</li>
    <li>Bearing fruit outside Christ isn&rsquo;t fruit [<em>Joh 15:4</em>].</li>
    <li>The Father could&rsquo;ve rejected Jesus, if He didn&rsquo;t remain in the Father&rsquo;s love [<em>Joh 15:10</em>].</li>
    <li>What Jesus said in Chapter 15 [and chapters before and after] He said specifically to His Apostles [<em>Joh 15:27</em>]. There are many great lessons the Church can learn from those Chapters, even though He was speaking directly to His Apostles, but
        we must know that the things were said primarily to them.</li>
    <li>The Holy Spirit will prove that Jesus is righteous, prove that the world is sinful, and that judgment is coming against the world [<em>Joh 16:7-11</em>].</li>
    <li>In the kingdom, there will still be learning, praying and receiving from God [<em>Joh 16:25-26</em>].</li>
