<header><h1>The Blind Servant of God</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>God cursed His people Israel with blindness [<em>Isa 6:8-13</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This isn&rsquo;t an Old Testament phenomenon, but the nature of God.</li>
            <li>The same curse is repeated by Jesus in the New Testament [<em>Mat 13:3-17</em>].</li>
            <li>Jesus used parables when speaking to those who were not granted understanding of the Kingdom's secrets, as they were not meant to receive this knowledge [<em>Mat 13:11</em>].<!--excerpt.end-->
                <ol>
                    <li>The purpose of parables is to conceal the message from outsiders.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus said those who have will be given more, and those who don&rsquo;t have, will have what little they do taken from them [<em>Mat 13:12-15</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>This means that the curse of blindness is a punishment for specific people, not the entire nations. The curse is conditional</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The curse is punishment for the people closing their eyes [<em>Mat 3:15</em>].</li>
            <li>If they turn from closing their eyes, the curse would be lifted [<em>Mat 3:15</em>].</li>
            <li>To &ldquo;<em>hear</em>&rdquo; the parable is to understand it [<em>Mat 13:18 KJV</em>].</li>
            <li>Jesus Christ was telling them they were doomed in a way they didn&rsquo;t understand. It&rsquo;s like a doctor telling a patient he is sick, but using words that the sick person can&rsquo;t understand.
                <ol>
                    <li>This goes to show the sternness of God. He is not as sentimental as people lie He is.</li>
                    <li>God said He would mock His people for failing to pay attention to Him. This is an example of a fulfilment [<em>Pro 1:22-33; Ezek 14:1-7</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>God calls such people simple, mockers, and fools [<em>Pro 1:22</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>He says that when they call to Him, He will not answer them [<em>Pro 1:28</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Animals pray to God [<em>Job 38:39-41</em>].</li>
            <li>Demons pray to and worship God [<em>Mar 5:1-15</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>The demons prayed Jesus to swear to not to torment them [<em>Mar 5:7</em>].</li>
                    <li>They prayed that He shouldn&rsquo;t send them out of the country [<em>Mar 5:10</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>They made the prayer more specific by asking He send them into the swine [<em>Mar 5:12</em>].</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>
        <ol>
            <li>God places good and evil before us and asks us to choose life [<em>Deu 30:19</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>If you choose darkness, heaven will oblige &ndash; as has been demonstrated above &ndash; and help you stay in darkness &ndash; in this case, by worsening the blindness</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>God speaks of His blind and deaf servants. He says they don&rsquo;t see, because they don&rsquo;t pay attention [<em>Isa 42:19-20</em>]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
