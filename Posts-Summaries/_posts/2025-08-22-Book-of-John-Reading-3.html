<header><h1>Book of John (Reading & Study 3)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>The Spirit does word associations. The rulers asked Jesus what authority He had to drive the people out of the &ldquo;<strong>Temple</strong>&rdquo;, and He responded saying &ldquo;tear down this <strong>Temple</strong>&rdquo; [<em>Joh 2:18</em>].</li>
    <li>Bethesda means &ldquo;House of Kindness&rdquo; [<em>Joh 5:1</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>One of God&rsquo;s objectives is that people will marvel [<em>Joh 5:20</em>].</li>
    <li>Another one of God&rsquo;s goals is that men honour Jesus, just as they honour him [<em>Joh 5:23</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus referred to Joh the Baptists as &ldquo;light/lamp&rdquo; [<em>Joh 5:35</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus said they search the Scriptures because they think in them, they have eternal life. He wasn&rsquo;t teaching that the Scriptures don&rsquo;t have eternal life, but that the Scriptures spoke of Him. He wasn&rsquo;t saying eternal life isn&rsquo;t
        in the Scriptures&mdash;as some people say. He was saying the Scriptures speak of Him. He was affirming the Scriptures, not pointing them to something apart from the Scriptures.</li>
    <li>Being &ldquo;filled with the Spirit&rdquo; is the New Testament equivalent of &ldquo;the Spirit of the Lord came upon him&rdquo; [<em>Eph 5:18-19</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>It doesn&rsquo;t mean that the person didn&rsquo;t have the Spirit before that time, just that it was not activated.</li>
            <li>To be filled with the Spirit, we should speak to one another in Psalms, hymns and spiritual songs&mdash;singing and making melody in our hearts [<em>Eph 5:19</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The Pharisees weren&rsquo;t trying to kill Jesus just because He called God His Father, but because He said that He could work because His Father worked [<em>Joh 5:17-18</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>If the Jews tried to kill Jesus just for calling God His Father&mdash;as people often claim&mdash;they would also be guilty because they also claimed God as their Father [<em>Joh 8:41</em>].</li>
            <li>There were very many other times before and after that Jesus called God &ldquo;Father&rdquo;&mdash;to both Himself and the people, and there were no reactions negative reactions [<em>Mat 6:1, 4, 6, 8, 9; 7:21; 10:32; Luk 10:22; Joh 2:16; 6:32 etc</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>There are two resurrections in John 5.
        <ol>
            <li>One resurrection for those who hear [<em>Joh 5:25</em>]</li>
            <li>Another for all the rest of the people [<em>Joh 5:28</em>]
                <ol>
                    <li>Those raised in this category will be judged according to what they&rsquo;ve done [<em>Joh 5:29</em>]</li>
                    <li>The good will rise to live, and the evil to be condemned.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This dispels the false doctrine that those who do not accept Jesus will burn in the Lake of Fire for all eternity.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Moses wrote of Jesus [<em>Joh 5:45-47</em>].</li>
