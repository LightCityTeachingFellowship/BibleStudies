<header><h1>The Sacrifice of Jesus</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Jesus became a bondservant to God by His death on the cross [<em>Exo 21:1-6; Heb 10:5-10; Psa 40:6-8</em>].<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>In place of sin offerings, God required the piercing of Jesus&rsquo; ears.</li>
            <li>God loves burnt offerings [<em>Lev 1:9</em>].</li>
            <li>Fire represents suffering. High positions are for those who have been baptized in fire [<em>Mat 3:11; Mat 20:22</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>Jesus said the place of His right and left hand are not His to give, but the Father&rsquo;s. This shows that the doctrine of the trinity is wrong.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Suffering / delay / hardship is how God takes ownership of us.</li>
        </ol>
