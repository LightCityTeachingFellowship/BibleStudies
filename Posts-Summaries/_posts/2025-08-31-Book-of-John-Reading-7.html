<header><h1>Book of John (Reading 7)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Jesus told the Jews that He could set them free and that they would be free indeed. By this, He meant that they were really slaves&mdash;contrary to the claims of the Jews that they weren&rsquo;t slaves&mdash;and that He could truly set them free
        [<em>Joh 8:30-36</em>].<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>They were slaves to sin, and even though they were Abraham&rsquo;s children, death would take them out of God&rsquo;s (Abraham&rsquo;s) house.</li>
            <li>Jesus offers true freedom&mdash;membership in God&rsquo;s house&mdash;that death had no power to undo.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>When Jesus said &ldquo;<em>From now on, you do know him and have seen him</em>&rdquo; [<em>Joh 14:7</em>], He was speaking the language of faith. He wasn&rsquo;t claiming that He was the Father, but that they should rest assured that&mdash;because
        they accepted Him (Jesus)&mdash;they would definitely see the Father.</li>
    <li>When Jesus says, &ldquo;<em>because I live, you also will live</em>&rdquo;, He speaks of the resurrection of the saints. Unlike the world, the saints will see Him again at the resurrection. In the very next verse, He says what day it is they&rsquo;ll
        see Him, and that makes it obvious that He was speaking of when He returns in glory [<em>Joh 14:19-20</em>].</li>
    <li>Those who don&rsquo;t love Jesus can be identified by their disobedience to His words [<em>Joh 14:24</em>].</li>
    <li>The Father wants the world to know that Jesus loves Him and does what He tells Him to do [<em>Joh 14:31</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This is because Jesus is to be Lord of all, and there must be no doubt as to His loyalty to God, or that His words are the exact words of God.</li>
            <li>The serpent once accused Jesus of not really representing the Father, when He asked Adam not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</li>
            <li>This is one of the reasons why God Jesus through the many trials He has been through&mdash;and is still going through.</li>
            <li>When Jesus&rsquo; trials are done, it will be clear to all that Jesus loves the Father and speaks for Him.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It is good that Jesus left, because His leaving meant the Comforter would come. In the context of John, the Comforter is our empowerment to become sons of God [<em>Joh 16:7</em>].</li>
    <li>When Jesus says that God will give us whatever we ask in His (Jesus&rsquo;) name, He was speaking of the say of His return, not after His resurrection [<em>Joh 16:23</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Even now, we can ask, but specifically, He&rsquo;s speaking of the day of His return</li>
            <li>This also shows that there will be prayer, even after Jesus&rsquo; return</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Another goal is overcoming the world&mdash;taking over the world [<em>Joh 16:33</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>This is one battle at a time&mdash;overcoming sin, temptation, etc., and eventually, when Jesus returns, we will literally take over the world</li>
            <li>We fight against the world by standing in righteousness</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus looked <strong>UP</strong> to heaven. Heaven is literally above [<em>Joh 17:1</em>].</li>
    <li>It appears that Jesus intends to define eternal life, but He begins His definition in an unconventional way [<em>Joh 17:3</em>]. He says &ldquo;&hellip;<strong><em>that</em></strong><em> they might know thee</em>&hellip;&rdquo;
        <ol>
            <li>The use of the word &ldquo;Might&rdquo; seems abnormal to use as a definition</li>
            <li>However, John uses the word &ldquo;<strong><em>hina</em></strong>&rdquo; (the word translated &ldquo;that&rdquo;) to mean when referring to definitions.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Again, Jesus wants the world to know that God sent Him [<em>Joh 17:21</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>The oneness isn&rsquo;t political or religious unions, but one in the Spirit of Truth [<em>Eph 4:3</em>]</li>
            <li>The we are to all have God&rsquo;s Spirit, and be united in doctrine, conduct and purpose.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>There&rsquo;s a unity that comes from the unity of the Spirit, which will take place at the resurrection [<em>Joh 17:22</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>We will all have one body and be one people.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God wants the world to know that He (God) loves Jesus and He sent Him
        <ol>
            <li>This is so that we can give Him the respect He deserves as God&rsquo;s beloved</li>
            <li>In the same the same way, God also wants that men know He loves us and sent us, that we too might be accorded the same respect.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
