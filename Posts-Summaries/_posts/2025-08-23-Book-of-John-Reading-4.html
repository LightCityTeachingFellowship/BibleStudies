<header><h1>Book of John (Reading 4)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Jesus literally came down from heaven [<em>Joh 6:62</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Manna literally fell from heaven</li>
            <li>Jesus is the true bread from heaven</li>
            <li>Bread is that which gives life [<em>Joh 6:33</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
            <li>If simply being sent by God is what it means to come from heaven, then all the prophets are also bread from heaven.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The man who accepts Jesus&rsquo; testimony certifies that God is truthful [<em>Joh 3:33-34</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Accepting Jesus&rsquo; words is saying God never lies</li>
            <li>Jesus&rsquo; words are God&rsquo;s words
                <ol>
                    <li>If you don&rsquo;t believe Jesus, you&rsquo;re actually rejecting God</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus testifies to what He has seen and heard [<em>Joh 3:32</em>]. Unless one believes God dictated everything He said and did, this means that Jesus actually saw and heard things from God, before His incarnation.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God&rsquo;s words aren&rsquo;t just true information-wise, but His words carry power, and Jesus&rsquo; words are equal to God, because God gave Him the Spirit without measure
        <ol>
            <li>God&rsquo;s words carry knowledge and power</li>
            <li>Having the Spirit without measure&mdash;as Jesus has&mdash;means having access to unlimited knowledge and power.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>In the same sermon where Jesus said He wouldn&rsquo;t cast away those who came to him, He cast people away with His message [<em>Joh 6:37</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This isn&rsquo;t contradictory, what Jesus is saying is that those who TRULY seek Him, are those He won&rsquo;t cast away. On the surface, many will come to Jesus&mdash;and He won&rsquo;t send them away&mdash;not directly. He would however
                put mechanisms in place that will weed them out. He didn&rsquo;t drive away the people, He just preached a message that revealed that they weren&rsquo;t truly seeking Him, and the proof of this was revealed in the fact that they left Him.</li>
            <li>Jesus won&rsquo;t ever reject those who are truly seeking Him.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>A perfect man is one who seeks the honour of the one who sent him [<em>Joh 7:18</em>]</li>
    <li>The Jews had an expectation that the Messiah would do many miracles [<em>Joh 7:31</em>].</li>
    <li>The one who is to be judge is without sin. Sinlessness is required to be judge [<em>Joh 8:7</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>To deliver the world from the accuser&mdash;from sin, the accuser has to be driven away [<em>Joh 8:10-11</em>].</li>
            <li>The accusers were driven away by Jesus pointing out their sins. In the same way, Jesus will call Satan&rsquo;s sins to account and drive him out.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus never explicitly said He was the Christ, yet He said to the Jews that He&rsquo;s the same person He&rsquo;s been claiming to be from the beginning [<em>Joh 8:25</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This is the way of God. He doesn&rsquo;t say things explicitly, He reveals enough for serious people to discern and make conclusions, but would hardly explicitly state things</li>
            <li>God expects us to pay attention [<em>Joh 42:18-20</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus must continue to please the Father for the Father not to leave Him [<em>Joh 8:29</em>].</li>
    <li>What did the Jews have in mind when they said they are Abraham&rsquo;s seed and never in bondage to any man [<em>Joh 8:33</em>]?
        <ol>
            <li>The Jews were in bondage to Pharoah, oppressed by Midian, Philistia, etc.; sacked by Assyria and Babylon. How then do they say they&rsquo;ve never been in bondage?</li>
            <li>Note that they tie their claim to being Abraham&rsquo;s children.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus responds to them by saying they&rsquo;re actually slaves who need freedom [<em>Joh 8:35-36</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus said that though they are members of God&rsquo;s family, they won&rsquo;t remain there forever, but that He&mdash;the Son&mdash;had power to give a place in the house.
        <ol>
            <li>According to Jesus&rsquo; judgment, those who don&rsquo;t listen to God&rsquo;s words are children of the devil [<em>Joh 8:44-47</em>].</li>
            <li>God is going to set up those who don&rsquo;t believe in the truth. He will send them a strong delusion that will make them commit very obvious sins [<em>2Ths 2:10-12</em>].</li>
            <li>By saying they&rsquo;re Abraham&rsquo;s Children, the Jews were saying they were God&rsquo;s children&mdash;members of His house.</li>
            <li>We can deduce that one of the things Jesus wasn&rsquo;t to achieve for us is permanence in God&rsquo;s house [<em>Joh 8:35-36</em>].</li>
            <li>Sin removes people from God&rsquo;s house, but not immediately</li>
            <li>Slavery to sin removes from the family&mdash;therefore sin isn&rsquo;t a part of God&rsquo;s house</li>
            <li>Slavery to sin doesn&rsquo;t stop from being a part of God&rsquo;s family but will eventually remove one from the family&mdash;and it does this through death.
                <ol>
                    <li>Cain wasn&rsquo;t immediately removed from God&rsquo;s presence in Eden, even thought he was already sinning.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus&rsquo; working of miracles on the Sabbath [<em>Joh 5; 9</em>] wasn&rsquo;t Him trying to provoke the Jews, but He was hinting to the fact that in the Sabbath of a thousand years (<em>e., the Millennium</em>), Israel would receive sight
                and be delivered from paralysis.</li>
            <li>To &ldquo;give God the glory&rdquo; is to tell the truth [<em>Joh 9:24</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>The same happened with Achan, when Joshua asked Achan to give God the glory.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The fold/sheep pen refers to nations [<em>Joh 10:16</em>].</li>
            <li>Jesus didn&rsquo;t decide to come by Himself, it was the Father who sent Him [<em>Joh 10:18</em>].</li>
            <li>Jesus said He was sanctified and <strong>sent into the world</strong> by God, because [<em>Joh 10:36</em>], because they said He was just a man [<em>Joh 10:33</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>He was saying the reason He&rsquo;s a man is because He was sent into the world.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The proof of Jesus&rsquo; sanctification is the power He has.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
