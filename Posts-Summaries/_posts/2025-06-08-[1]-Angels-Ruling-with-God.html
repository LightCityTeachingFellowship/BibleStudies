<header><h1>[1] Angels Ruling with God (The Divine Council)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start--><p>God doesn&rsquo;t rule alone. He rules with angels in heaven.</p>
<p>God has a government. He&rsquo;s the supreme ruler, but He has a council &ndash; a government who partake of the governing process as God wills. The following are passages in the scriptures that show this.</p><!--excerpt.end-->
<ol>
    <li><strong>The death of Ahab</strong> was orchestrated by the council -- it wasn&rsquo;t just God&rsquo;s sole decision [<em>1kgs 22:19-23</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>God didn&rsquo;t just decree Ahab&rsquo;s death but stated what He wanted and asked for suggestions on how it should happen. The council was involved in God&rsquo;s decision to kill Ahab</li>
            <li>Ahab disguised himself to try to escape the word of God that came from Micaiah the prophet [<em>1Kgs 22:30</em>]</li>
            <li>The Arameans turned from pursuing because king Jehoshaphat when they discovered he wasn&rsquo;t Ahab, because their king had given them a command to go after no one &ndash; small or great &ndash; except king Ahab [<em>1Kgs 22:31-33</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The trials of Job</strong> [<em>Job 1:1-12; 2:</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>God claimed that Job feared Him and shunned evil, and Satan claimed that Job really didn&rsquo;t love God, but that Job was only loyal because God had blessed him. Job was tested by the divine council to see if he was truly loyal &ndash; to
                see if Job really loved God [<em>Job 1:8-11</em>].</li>
            <li>The Angels (sons of God) and Satan presented themselves before God, and Job was tested.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Assembly of gods</strong> [<em>Psa 82:1-7</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>This is a Psalm is Asaph [<em>Psa 82:1</em>]
                <ol>
                    <li>Asaph was a prophet &ndash; a seer.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>God presides in the Assembly / Council / Congregation of the gods.
                <ol>
                    <li>There is a ruling council in heaven.</li>
                    <li>God presides over the council.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>In this Psalm, God judged the members of the council who failed to do what they were tasked to do.
        <li>Those over who God presides are not mortals &ndash; this is seen from God saying they would die like men. It is vain to threaten men that they will die like men [<em>Psa 82:7</em>].</li>
        <li>It is God who made them gods [<em>Psa 82:6</em>].</li>
        <li>Since God is judging them, clearly, He was the one who appointed them to govern the earth</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Isaiah&rsquo;s Commission</strong> [<em>Isa 6:1-</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Yahweh acknowledges others as ruling with Him &ndash; when He says &ldquo;who will go for &ldquo;<strong>US</strong>&rdquo; [<em>Isa 6:8</em>]</li>
            <li>Prophets &ndash; though servants of God &ndash; are appointed not just by God, but by His council/government</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Creation</strong> [<em>Gen 1:26; 2:18; 3:22</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Let &ldquo;<strong>US</strong>&rdquo; make man in &ldquo;<strong>OUR</strong>&rdquo; image [<em>Gen 1:26</em>]</li>
            <li>The Septuagint says &ldquo;Let <strong>US</strong>&rdquo; make a helper for Him:
                <ol>
                    <li><em>And said the lord God, It is not good to be for the man alone, let <strong>us</strong> make for him a helper according to him!</em>[<em>ABP-en+&nbsp;Gen&nbsp;2:18</em>]</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>God said man has become one of &ldquo;<strong>US</strong>&rdquo; [<em>Gen 3:22</em>]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The Division of Nations</strong> [<em>Gen 11:7</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>This account contrasts man&rsquo;s &ldquo;let <strong>US</strong>&rdquo; with God&rsquo;s &ldquo;let <strong>US</strong>&rdquo;.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s Dream</strong> [<em>Dan 4:1-37</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>God does not rule alone, but with his holy ones &ndash; the angels</li>
            <li>God with His angels make decrees concerning who rules the nations</li>
            <li>The decree against Nebuchadnezzar was described as being both from God and from the angels
                <ol>
                    <li>It is called both the decree of the Most High and of the watchers &ndash; to the intent that all will know that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of men [<em>Dan 4:17</em>].</li>
                    <li>God is still the one in charge.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The one ruling is identified as the Most High, and also all of heaven [<em>Dan 4:26</em>]
        <li>Heaven is made up of not just the Most High, but of others as well, so saying heaven rules is saying that God rules with the Angels.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
    <li>Given what we have seen thus far, it can be concluded that this present world is ruled by angels &ndash; a thing hinted at in Hebrews 2:5.
        <ol>
            <li>This being the case, we can describe every previous word spoken as the word of angels [<em>Heb 2:2</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
