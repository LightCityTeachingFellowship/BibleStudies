<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Jesus said &ldquo;Unless I wash you, you have no part with me&rdquo; [<em>Joh 13:8</em>].<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>To belong to Jesus, one has to be washed.</li>
            <li>Even after being clean, one still needs to be washed</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Although it isn&rsquo;t wrong to do so, Jesus doesn&rsquo;t mean His disciples should literally wash each other&rsquo;s feet.</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; knowledge is meant to be proof that He&rsquo;s who He claims to be [<em>Joh 13:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus hid Himself when He perceived danger. We should therefore not be reckless.</li>
