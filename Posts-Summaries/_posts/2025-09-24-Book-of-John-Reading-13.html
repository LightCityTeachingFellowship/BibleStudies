<!--excerpt.start-->
<p>The following are some points on eternal life to be gleaned from John</p>
<!--excerpt.end-->
<ol>
    <li>Living water doesn&rsquo;t mean water that gives life, but water that is alive [<em>Joh 4:10</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>The water does in fact give life, but what makes it living water isn&rsquo;t that it gives life, but that the water itself is alive</li>
            <li>Living water means the water is flowing&mdash;the water is quick.
                <ol>
                    <li>Well water is living water because when you draw from it, it rises.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The living water is the Holy Spirit [<em>Joh 4:14; 7:38-39</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>The Holy Spirit will be in us until we have eternal life.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The fruit gathered unto eternal life is people/souls [<em>Joh 4:36</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>The harvest is eternal life</li>
                    <li>God&rsquo;s servants labour to bring men into eternal life</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus speaks of the first resurrection when He says that &ldquo;those who hear the voice of the Son of God will live&rdquo; [<em>Joh 5:25</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>This is for those who accept His words</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus speaks of the resurrection where ALL will rise, not just &ldquo;those who hear&rdquo; [<em>Joh 5:29</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>Those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned.</li>
                    <li>Eternal life is for those who have done good [<em>Joh 5:29</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Just as the living water wells up into eternal life, the meat which doesn&rsquo;t perish endures unto eternal life [<em>Joh 4:14; 6:27</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>Jesus is the meat that doesn&rsquo;t perish, and unlike earthly high priests who die, Jesus lives and will continue to do so, till we get to eternal life.</li>
                    <li>It appears that eternal life is a time&mdash;an age.</li>
                    <li>Eternal life is also location [<em>Mat 18:8; 19:17</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>There is no corruption in heaven [<em>Mat 6:19</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Even though Enoch, Melchizedek, Moses, Elijah and other we may not know of are still in this flesh, they&rsquo;re still alive in heaven, because there&rsquo;s no corruption there.</p>
