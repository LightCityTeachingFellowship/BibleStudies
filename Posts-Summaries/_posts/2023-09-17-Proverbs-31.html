<header><h1>Proverbs 31</h1></header>
<ol>
    <li>King Lemuel received counsel from his mother, and his mother will share in the glory attributed to him, for she was a part of his upbringing.
        <ol>
            <li>This can be seen in the books of the Kings of Israel and Judah, where the mothers and wives were many times mentioned in relation to a king&rsquo;s success or failure.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Kings are not to drink wine [<em>Pro 31:4-7</em>]</li>
    <li>The husband of the proverbs 31 woman is an elder at the gates of the city; i.e., he&rsquo;s a respectable man, yet his wife worked [<em>Pro 31:13-24</em>]. She was no housewife who just sat at home but a businesswoman.
        <ol>
            <li>She wakes up before dawn [<em>Pro 31:15</em>].</li>
            <li>The woman has female servants, not male servants [<em>Pro 31:15</em>].</li>
            <li>It is Biblically okay to borrow for business, but not for consumption [<em>2Kgs 4:3</em>].</li>
            <li>It is okay to have servants [<em>Pro 31:15</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>Elijah, despite what appears to be his earthly poverty, had servants serve him. Servants are needed, especially in the service of God&rsquo;s servants.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>If one wants a harvest, he must be ready to do the work required [<em>Pro 14:4</em>].</li>
            <li>The noble wife has savings, and reinvests them [<em>Pro 31:16</em>]. She bought the field out of her own savings, not from her husbands.</li>
            <li>King Xerxes called for Vashti to display her beauty to his officials, just as God called Job to be displayed before His officials &ndash; the heavenly council.</li>
            <li>The noble woman is nice and generous [<em>Pro 31:20</em>]</li>
            <li><strong>The wife is the one who watches over the affairs of the household, not the husband [<em>Pro 31:27</em>]</strong>.</li>
            <li>A woman is not to be praised for beauty or charm, but for her fear of God, and by implication, the godly attributes that come with it [<em>Pro 31:30</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
