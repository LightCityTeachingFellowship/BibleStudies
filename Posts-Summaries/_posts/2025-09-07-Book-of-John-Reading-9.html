<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Pilate understood the words of the Jews concerning Jesus to mean that Jesus came from above [<em>Joh 19:7-8</em>].</li>
    <li>There are grades of sin, some sins are greater than others [<em>Joh 19:11</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>Mary said, &ldquo;<strong>WE</strong> don&rsquo;t know where they have put Him&rdquo;. Though it&rsquo;s not recorded here, Mary wasn&rsquo;t the only one who was there [<em>Joh 20:2</em>].</li>
    <li>After Jesus&rsquo; resurrection, He called God His God and Father [<em>Joh 20:17</em>].</li>
    <li>It is the actual body of Jesus that died that rose. It wasn&rsquo;t a different body, or some apparition, but the same Jesus, with the same body [Joh 20:20].</li>
    <li>All the Apostles were given the power to forgive sins, not Just Peter [<em>Joh 20:23</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>The elders also have the power to forgive sins [<em>Jas 5:14-15</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The number of fish was enough to break the net, but the net wasn&rsquo;t broken. This was a miracle [<em>Joh 21:11</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus must have come in a different form at the shore [<em>Joh 21:12</em>].</li>
    <li>When Jesus said to Peter &ldquo;follow me&rdquo;, He wasn&rsquo;t asking Peter to be His disciple afresh, but He was asking Peter to follow His steps and die like He did [<em>Joh 21:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus repeated the miracle of making the disciples catch a large number of fish after His resurrection, and that was how John recognized that it was Jesus [<em>Joh 21:4-6</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>In this case, unlike Jesus&rsquo;s earlier performance of the same type of miracle [<em>Luk 5:1-6</em>], the net didn&rsquo;t break</li>
            <li>Repeating the miracle was His way of identifying Himself to His disciples.</li>
            <li>It&rsquo;s a pattern with God to repeat things&mdash;so that we can identify Him/His works.
                <ol>
                    <li>At the burning bush and at Jericho, both Moses and Joshua were asked to take off their shoes. This was God&rsquo;s way of identifying that Moses and Joshua interacted with the same person [<em>Exo 3:1-6; Jos 5:13-15</em>].</li>
                    <li>&ldquo;[My] Angel will go before you&rdquo; [<em>Exo 23:20-23; 32:34; 33:2; Mic 2:13; Zec 12:8</em>] was what God said to Israel. Micah and Zechariah also speak of a character going before Israel/God&rsquo;s people.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Actions also atone for sins [<em>Pro 16:6</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>Asking for forgiveness in itself isn&rsquo;t sufficient. We must prove through love and faithfulness that we have repented of sin.</li>
                    <li>Heaven knows we have repented&mdash;not because we say we&rsquo;ve repented, but because we do the works of repentance. By our fruits will we be known.</li>
                    <li>This is why Peter had to atone for his three-time denial of Jesus, by showing that he loved Jesus three times.</li>
