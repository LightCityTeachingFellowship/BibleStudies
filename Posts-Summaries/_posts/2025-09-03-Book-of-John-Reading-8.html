<header><h1>Book of John (Reading 8)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>We have to be clean to belong to Jesus and the Father [<em>Joh 13:8</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; atonement and intercession cleanse us from sin, but we too must not walk in sin.</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>He that is washed is clean, and need only wash his feet [<em>Joh 13:10</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus&rsquo; salvation accomplished for us what we couldn&rsquo;t do by ourselves, but we must do that which is within our ability to do&mdash;which is to obey the Father.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We make mistakes, but we should strive for cleanliness.</li>
    <li>We receive Jesus by receiving those He sent [<em>Joh 13:20</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>We receive those Jesus sent by believing and accepting their message.</li>
            <li>We can thus rephrase Jesus&rsquo; words &ldquo;if a man loves me, he will receive my word, and my Father will love Him&rdquo; [<em>Joh 14:23</em>].</li>
            <li>Those who don&rsquo;t accept Jesus&rsquo; words are judged as those who do not love Him.</li>
            <li>Those who keep His word, are considered lovers of God.</li>
            <li>Those who love God, God will love in return.
                <ol>
                    <li>He&rsquo;ll make them His children and grant them special blessings.</li>
                    <li>God loves the humble and contrite, and He will cause them to partake of the resurrection [<em>Isa 57:15</em>].</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Sanctification by the word is as we follow God&rsquo;s word&mdash;as we believe His messengers&mdash;He considers us as those who love Him, and He loves us in return, and those God loves are sanctified.</li>
            <li>What God has prepared isn&rsquo;t for all mankind, or for those who come to Church, but for those who love Him [<em>1Co 2:9</em>].</li>
            <li>Those who don&rsquo;t have regard for God&rsquo;s word declare&mdash;by their act of rejecting His word&mdash;that they don&rsquo;t love God [<em>Joh 5:42</em>].</li>
            <li>When Scriptures say Jesus was silent like a lamb to slaughter, it doesn&rsquo;t mean He didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; speak at all. Jesus evidently spoke at His trial [<em>Joh 18:23</em>].</li>
            <li>Some claim that the Bible is false for saying the Jews said it was unlawful for them to put any to death. The claim is that historically, Jews were able to kill. However, the very next verse explains that things played out this way so that
                Jesus&rsquo; prophecy of&mdash;<strong>the kind of death He was to die</strong>&mdash;would be fulfilled [<em>Joh 18:31-32</em>].</li>
            <li>Pilate asked Jesus if He was a king, which&mdash;even though it wasn&rsquo;t stated&mdash;implies that the Jews told Pilate that Jesus claimed He was [<em>Joh 18:34</em>].</li>
            <li>All who partook in Jesus&rsquo; death&mdash;the Jews, Pilate, Judas, etc.&mdash;are guilty, but those who handed Jesus over to them&mdash;the gods of this age&mdash;have greater guilt [<em>Joh 19:11</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>This gives Jesus legal right to go after Satan. Even though Satan afflicted men, it would seem like Jesus was meddling by getting involved, but in becoming a man and being killed by the gods of this age&mdash;especially since He was
                        innocent&mdash;Jesus now has right to avenge Himself.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Pilate was inclined to believe Jesus, but the stubbornness of the Jews hindered him [<em>Joh 19:21</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
