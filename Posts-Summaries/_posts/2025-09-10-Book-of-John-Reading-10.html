<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>When Jesus says, &ldquo;from henceforth, ye know Him and have seen Him&rdquo;, He was speaking prophetically. He was saying they would see God in the future [<em>Joh 14:7</em>].</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>The fruit of we&rsquo;re expected to bear as we abide in Jesus is the fruit of making disciples, therefore this portion of Scripture speaks specifically to ministers&mdash;although it also applies to the believers as a whole [<em>Joh 15:1-8</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus sent His apostles to make the disciples of all nations, not the Church as a whole.</li>
            <li>The early Church referred to the authority of the apostles.
                <ol>
                    <li>Even though the Holy Spirit came upon the believers at Pentecost, it was the 12 who led the charge.</li>
                    <li>It is also seen in the fact that they appointed Matthias to take Judas&rsquo; office</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>If all believers were equal, this wouldn&rsquo;t have been so.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
    <li>The Apostle Paul wasn&rsquo;t Judas&rsquo; replacement, Matthias was.
        <ol>
            <li>By their criteria, Judas&rsquo; replacement had to be one who was with Jesus from the beginning of His ministry to His ascension.</li>
