<header><h1>[2] Colossians</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>The will of God is what is known by wisdom, not necessarily by prophetic word [<em>Col 1:9</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>There are two sources of knowledge from God &ndash; the priests and the prophets<!--excerpt.end-->
                <ol>
                    <li>The Priests can speak from God, but they also make known the will of God through teaching [<em>Mal 2:7</em>]</li>
                    <li>Prophets also speak, but mostly words from God</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Where priests know the will of God, the prophet is redundant</li>
            <li>We&rsquo;re called to be Kings and Priests, not Kings and Prophets
                <ol>
                    <li>Therefore it is knowledge that&rsquo;s really required of us</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Prophets don&rsquo;t need the word of God to hear from God; they hear directly from God.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God&rsquo;s wrath is coming upon man, not because of Adam&rsquo;s sin &ndash; as is commonly taught, but because of the disobedience of the sinner [<em>Eph 5:3-6</em>].</li>
    <li>The good, acceptable and perfect will of God isn&rsquo;t three separate wills of God as some say; but the will of God is good, acceptable and perfect. It&rsquo;s not three different wills, but one will [<em>Rom 12:2</em>].</li>
    <li>&ldquo;Strengthening&rdquo; in Colossians 1:11 is by God working His power among us, not by some metaphysical &ldquo;strengthening of the mind&rdquo;
        <ol>
            <li>When God manifests His power among us, we have evidence that God is, and that the hope is sure, even when one is going through trials.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The goal of the Apostles is not just to turn people to Christ, but to bring them to maturity [<em>Col 1:28</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Seeing as this is the goal of the Apostles, we can confidently conclude that it is therefore God&rsquo;s will that the saints grow to maturity.</li>
            <li>Cornelius and the Ethiopian Eunuch aren&rsquo;t examples of believers who turned to the Lord and weren&rsquo;t discipled.
                <ol>
                    <li>It&rsquo;s unreasonable to conclude that Cornelius &ndash; who lived in Caesarea (a city in the coasts of Judaea) &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t have access to other Christians who could teach him, or that he couldn&rsquo;t just have sent
                        to Peter, or gone to meet him on occasion, to learn more of the faith.</li>
                    <li>The Ethiopian Eunuch went to Jerusalem to worship, who is to say that He couldn&rsquo;t return to learn, or that He didn&rsquo;t seek out other Christians.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The fact that God has forgiven us our sins means that we&rsquo;re alive [<em>Col 2:13</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>This means &ndash; that we have eternal life already &ndash; but that since we are forgiven, we will live and not die.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus cancelled the written code (i.e. the Law) with its regulations by His crucifixion [<em>Col 2:14</em>]. It was Jesus&rsquo; crucifixion that abolished the Law.</li>
            <li>The power the princes of this age have over us is by the Law [<em>Col 2:15</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
