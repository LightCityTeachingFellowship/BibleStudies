<header><h1>Colossians 1</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>Who also declared unto us your love &ldquo;<strong><em>in the Spirit</em></strong>&rdquo; [<em>Col 1:8</em>]. This is as opposed to the Law. The &ldquo;<strong><em>in</em></strong>  <strong><em>the Spirit</em></strong>&rdquo; refers to being in the
        New Covenant. See Jude 1:20</li>
    <li>To know God&rsquo;s will, one should have spiritual wisdom and understanding [<em>Col 1:9</em>]</li><!--excerpt.end-->
    <li>To live a life worthy of God &ndash; a life that pleases Him, we need to know His will [<em>Col 1:9-10</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Faith isn&rsquo;t all that matters, it&rsquo;s not all that&rsquo;s required to please God. Paul tells us that we need to understand His will so that we can live a life worthy of Him &ndash; being fruitful in every good work and increasing
                in the knowledge of God This is pleasing to God [<em>Col 1:9-10</em>].</li>
            <li>The goal is to please Him in every way by bearing good fruit [<em>Col 1:10</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God working miracles among us &ndash; showing us His power &ndash; strengthens us [<em>Col 1:11</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This doesn&rsquo;t mean fulfils every need.</li>
            <li>In the wilderness, rather than give them what they lusted after, He gave them Manna. His power was there in the cloud, but it didn&rsquo;t mean He gave them all they asked</li>
            <li>Even Jesus asked God that the cup pass over Him &ndash; if possible &ndash; yet God didn&rsquo;t answer Him but strengthened Him.</li>
            <li>Go will do things to confirm that He is with us, but He&rsquo;s not our butler at out beck and call, doing everything we ask of Him.</li>
            <li>The reason God manifests His power &ndash; according to the Apostle Paul in this place &ndash; is so that we will have patience and endurance with joy [<em>Col 1:11</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The Holy Spirit given to us by God is a deposit that guarantees our inheritance [<em>Eph 1:15</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>When God works His power among us by His Spirit, it should remind us of the glorious inheritance kept in-store for us.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>We&rsquo;ve been translated into the kingdom of God&rsquo;s Son by forgiveness of sins and Jesus&rsquo;s identity and authority [<em>Col 1:14-18</em>].</li>
    <li>When Paul says God will reconcile all things to Himself, he doesn&rsquo;t mean it in the sense of reconciling two enemies and restoring them to friendship. It just means God will restore order [<em>Col 1:20</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Some have stretched this to mean that God will make peace with devils, but this is counter to Scripture &ndash; as the Bible says that Satan will be crushed under our feet [<em>Rom 16:20</em>].</li>
            <li>Reconciliation here refers to putting things in their right place which &ndash; for the devil and his allies &ndash; means being subdued under the righteous.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God&rsquo;s goal is so that we will be free from accusation [<em>Col 1:22</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This will happen if we continue in faith</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Paul said God commissioned him to give us the word in its fullness. This means all of God&rsquo;s revealed word (<em>e. the Scriptures</em>) can be known [<em>Col 1:23</em>]</li>
