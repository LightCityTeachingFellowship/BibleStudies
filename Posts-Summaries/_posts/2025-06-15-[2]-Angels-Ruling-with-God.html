<header><h1>[2] Angels Ruling with God (The Divine Council)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start--><ol>
    <li>No king rules alone, but every king has officials under him. So too God. This is the summary of God&rsquo;s divine council.<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>The council is God&rsquo;s governing body.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Another way to understand the council is to see it as those who have access to God&rsquo;s court
        <ol>
            <li>Even in earthly kingdoms, citizens don&rsquo;t just have access to the rulers, but certain officials do</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>By His design, God cannot rule alone &ndash; not because He lacks the strength to do so, but because it will wear out creation [<em>Exo 18:14-18</em>]
        <ol>
            <li>God&rsquo;s dominion is vast and His subjects innumerable, so it would be impractical to rule it all alone.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The divine council follows the principles of governments
        <ol>
            <li>Not that the council copies earthly governments &ndash; rather, the earth is trying to mirror what is already in heaven.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The entire council serves God, to maintain order and to do good [<em>Rom 13:4</em>]</li>
    <li>There are different ranks among them</li>
    <li>They keep records of the following.
        <ol>
            <li>God&rsquo;s words / decrees / prophecies / judgments [<em>Psa 119:89</em>]
                <ol>
                    <li>They work to fulfil His words [<em>Psa 103:20</em>]</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>They keep records of God&rsquo;s subjects [<em>Rev 20:12</em>]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>God is the one who established the council [<em>Psa 82:6</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Since their establishment, God has done apart from them. For God to act without them would be to render them pointless.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Members of the council present cases before God, seeking His judgments [<em>Job 33:23-25</em>].</li>
</ol>
