<header><h1>Book of John (Reading & Study 11)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>When Jesus said no one comes through the Father through Him, He wasn&rsquo;t speaking of prayer. He was speaking of literally coming to the Father [<em>Joh 14:6</em>]<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>He was speaking of the same coming to the Father of which He spoke to Nicodemus, when He said one must be born again to enter God&rsquo;s kingdom, and of the true worshippers who worship God in spirit and truth</li>
            <li>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that praying in Jesus&rsquo; name is wrong. It&rsquo;s right to pray in Jesus&rsquo; name&mdash;only that&rsquo;s not what the verse is teaching.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus said to the twelve, &ldquo;<em>believe me that I am in the Father</em>&rdquo; [<em>Joh 14:11</em>]. He was speaking directly to the disciples with Him at that time. Then in the following verses, He says &ldquo;<em>whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing</em>&rdquo;
        [<em>Joh 14:12</em>]. Those who believe in Him&mdash;those who will do the works He does and greater&mdash;are those to whom He spoke in the previous verse&mdash;not the entire Church.</li>
    <li>The Apostles will do greater works because Jesus goes to the Father [<em>Joh 14:13</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>This happened because Jesus will ascend to the Father&rsquo;s right hand.</li>
            <li>Interestingly, Jesus&mdash;not exactly His Apostles&mdash;is He who will do the greater works. This is seen when Jesus said that when they ask in His name, He&mdash;Jesus&mdash;will do what they ask [<em>Joh 14:13</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>This doesn&rsquo;t only apply to the twelve, but to those Jesus send. Neither Paul not Barnabas were of the twelve, but were also sent by God, and great signs followed them.</li>
    <li>Apostles are supposed to have signs following them [<em>2Co 12:12</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>Note that it doesn&rsquo;t say that these signs will follow all Christians, but Apostles.</li>
            <li>Apostles are also supposed to have revelation of the truth of God&rsquo;s word [<em>Eph 3:5</em>].</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The Gospels and Acts are written not just to talk of Jesus, but of the establishment of the Church, and of the Apostles. This is seen in the emphasis on &ldquo;<em>the Disciples and Peter</em>&rdquo; [<em>Mar 16:7</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus sent the Apostles to go to the world and preach. He told them that those who believe will be saved and those who don&rsquo;t, would be condemned. He proceeds to say that signs shall &ldquo;<strong>follow/accompany</strong>&rdquo;, those who
        believe, but the people signs &ldquo;<strong>follow</strong>&rdquo; are those who are sent [<em>Mar 16:15-17</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>&ldquo;<em>and they <strong>went</strong> forth preached and confirming the words with signs <strong>following</strong></em>&rdquo; [<em>Mar 16:20</em>].</li>
            <li>This confirms that the signs follow those who are sent to preach, not just those who believe.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>For the entire Church however, after the first resurrection, the signs will follow all who believe.</li>
</ol>
