<header><h1>Book of John (Reading & Study 1)</h1></header>
<!--excerpt.start-->
<ol>
    <li>&ldquo;The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness didn&rsquo;t <strong>understand</strong> it&rdquo;. The translations that render the verse as &ldquo;understand/comprehend&rdquo; are correct. The verse doesn&rsquo;t speak of light overcoming
        darkness&mdash;as the ESV puts it&mdash;but of darkness not understanding light. The context of the book of John agrees with this interpretation. [<em>Joh 1:5</em>].<!--excerpt.end-->
        <ol>
            <li>It means the world does not understand Jesus</li>
            <li>This is further evidenced by the fact that the world and His own didn&rsquo;t know or receive Him [<em>Joh 1:10-11</em>]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred <strong>before</strong> me: for he was <strong>before</strong>
        <br />[<em>Joh 1:15</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>The words &ldquo;<strong>before (&eacute;mprosthen)</strong>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<strong>before (protos)</strong>&rdquo; though the same in English, are different words in the Greek.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The Jews asked what authority Jesus had to drive the merchants out of the temple [<em>Joh 2:18-19</em>]. They didn&rsquo;t care whether or not what He did/said was right but just questioned His authority.
        <ol>
            <li>It&rsquo;s not wrong to want to know what authority one has, but that alone isn&rsquo;t what matters. What should really matter&mdash;or matter most&mdash;is whether or not what Jesus said was correct.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Jesus worked miracles in Jerusalem [<em>Joh 2:23</em>].</li>
    <li>Nicodemus said they know Jesus is a teacher sent from God [<em>Joh 3:2</em>]. John doesn&rsquo;t present any teaching of Jesus up to this point, but Nicodemus says they know He&rsquo;s a teacher sent from God.
        <ol>
            <li>This means Jesus would&rsquo;ve taught, even though it wasn&rsquo;t recorded up to this point.</li>
            <li>Nicodemus said, &ldquo;<strong>WE</strong> know you&rsquo;re a teacher from God&rdquo;. This means that there were others in the Sanhedrin&mdash;not just Nicodemus&mdash;who believed in Jesus.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>It can be deduced that Jesus&rsquo; message was the Kingdom [<em>Joh 3:3</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>John was teaching us that Jesus&rsquo; message was the Kingdom of God</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The beginning of the Biblical books usually show the reader what to look out for from the book.
        <ol>
            <li>Why did John begin by telling us the Word was with God in the beginning [<em>Joh 1:1</em>]?</li>
            <li>John emphasizes it in the second verse, again, showing that it was important to him [<em>Joh 1:2</em>].</li>
            <li>How did John know that the Word was in the beginning with God, and that the Word was God? How did he know that all things were made by Him?</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>John wasn&rsquo;t saying that every man who comes into the world has eternal life [<em>Joh 1:9</em>]. Men do not all have the light of Jesus. That&rsquo;s a misreading of this verse</li>
    <li>There were people among the Jews who believed that &ldquo;The Prophet&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Christ&rdquo; were two different people [<em>Joh 1:22, 25</em>].</li>
    <li>&ldquo;<em>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?.</em>&rdquo; The Jews believed in Baptism, they also believed that only Christ, Elijah, or the Prophet can baptize
        [<em>Joh 1:25</em>].
        <ol>
            <li>They believe it takes a great prophet to baptize.</li>
            <li>Baptism has to do with authority.
                <ol>
                    <li>Israel was baptized into Moses, and Christians are baptized into Christ.</li>
                    <li>The Jews believed that only the Prophet, Christ and Elijah, had the authority to baptize.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>John Said Jesus would baptize with the Holy Spirit [<em>Joh 1:33</em>]. He wasn&rsquo;t making it up. The prophets also spoke of God &lsquo;<strong>POURING</strong>&rsquo; out His Spirit on flesh.
                <ol>
                    <li>The use of the word &lsquo;<strong>pour</strong>&rsquo; implies being drenched in the water, being under it, not a sprinkling.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus commends Nathanael for righteousness [<em>Joh 1:47</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>He was righteous before even meeting Jesus&mdash;before receiving the Holy Spirit.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Nathanael called Jesus &ldquo;the Son of God, the King of Israel&rdquo;. He knew that the Christ and the Prophet are the same person [<em>Joh 1:49</em>].</li>
            <li>Jesus commended Nathanael for his faith&mdash;especially since he didn&rsquo;t require much to know and accept who Jesus was.
                <ol>
                    <li>It&rsquo;s important to note that John&rsquo;s testimony must&rsquo;ve also most likely played a role in Nathanael&rsquo;s belief.</li>
                    <li>Jesus&rsquo; commendation of Nathanael by saying he would see greater things [<em>Joh 1:50</em>]. It should be noted that when you see and believe, you&rsquo;re qualified to see greater things.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Jesus&rsquo; turning of water to wine was described as a &ldquo;revelation of His glory&rdquo; [<em>Joh 2:11</em>].
                <ol>
                    <li>The show of Jesus&rsquo; power is a revelation of His glory.</li>
                    <li>Power is glory.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>John said Jesus came from above [<em>Joh 3:31</em>]. Most Christians interpret this literally and believe it to mean Jesus pre-existed and was sent down as a man. Some believe otherwise and point to John the Baptist of whom it was said that
                he sent by God [<em>Joh 1:6</em>]. They interpret Jesus&rsquo; being from above (<em>e., from God</em>) to mean He was sent by God just as John was. Such people say, &ldquo;if Jesus being from God means He pre-existed, then John the Baptist
                must have also pre-existed, as he too, came from God&rdquo; This ignores the rest of the verse that says that He who came from above is above all, and the others are from the earth. John the Baptist is of the earth and isn&rsquo;t above
                all. If Jesus coming from God is the same as John&rsquo;s being sent by God, why then does Jesus&rsquo; being from above make Him above all? Shouldn&rsquo;t John also be above all?</li>
        </ol>
