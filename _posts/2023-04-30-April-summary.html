<ol>
    <li>There are certain men heaven considers for a particular reason or purpose.</li>
    <li>Job is an example of man who was considered by heaven for something</li>
    <li>This can be seen in God&rsquo;s question to Satan concerning Job, when God asked &ldquo;<em>Have you considered my servant Job</em>&rdquo; [<em>Job 1:8; 2:3</em>]</li>
    <li>Conditions for being a considered man
        <ol>
            <li>Faithfulness</li>
            <li>Prophethood</li>
            <li>Being chosen by God</li>
            <li>Righteousness</li>
            <li>Power</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Moses was chosen by God over Korah, Dathan and Abiram</li>
    <li>Moses was faithful</li>
    <li>Job was a prophet &ndash; he saw God.</li>
    <li>The council was looking for king of the earth. This can be seen in the fact that he was compared to all the men on the earth.</li>
    <li>The Pharisees believed in baptism and knew that you need high authority from God to baptize [Joh 1:25]. They expected that Elijah, the Prophet, and the Christ were ones who had authority to baptize.</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; disciples believed that the Messiah was &ldquo;the Prophet&rdquo;. Their understanding was better than that of the Pharisees who differentiated The Prophet from the Christ.</li>
    <li>They also knew that Jesus was the Son of God, the King of Israel.</li>
    <li>Some prophesies are only meant to be understood after they have been fulfilled [Joh 2:20-22]. It was after His resurrection that they understood what He meant by destroying the temple and rebuilding in 3 days.</li>
    <li>The miracles of Jesus prove that He is from God &ndash; according to Nicodemus [Joh 3:2]</li>
    <li>Born Again means to be born of the Spirit &ndash; according to Jesus [Joh 3:7-8]. Therefore, seeing the kingdom and entering the kingdom are the same [Joh 3:3, 5].</li>
    <li>That Jesus has access to heaven is one of John&rsquo;s major points thus far [Joh 3:13]. He made mention of Jesus being with God in the beginning.</li>
    <li>Jesus is superior because He is from above [Joh 3:31]. If being from above means He was sent by heaven &ndash; like other prophets &ndash; then Jesus cannot be superior. If this means He was sent by heaven like other prophets, then the statement is
        meaningless.</li>
    <li>Life is a place, i.e., that place is the source of life, it is the place where there is access to life [Joh 3:36]</li>
    <li>Jesus is called the word by John because He speaks the words of God; He has the words of life.</li>
    <li>When the Spirit of God came upon Christ at the baptism, it did not make Jesus the Son of God, He received the Spirit of God because He is the Son of God.</li>
    <li>Descent from David or virgin birth is not what makes Jesus the Son of God.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Wednesday 5<sup>th</sup> April 2023 Message Summary Notes</h1>
<h2>Notes from John 3</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The birth Jesus speaks about is the birth of/by the Spirit [<em>Joh 3:3-9</em>].</li>
    <li>In the words of Jesus to Nicodemus, there is no difference between seeing the kingdom and entering into it [<em>Joh 3:3-8</em>].</li>
    <li>Being born of the Spirit is the same thing as being born again.
        <ol>
            <li>We know this because in explaining to Nicodemus what it means to be born again &ndash; using the analogy of the wind, He concludes His explanation by saying &ldquo;so it is with everyone born of the Spirit&rdquo; [<em>Joh 3:7-8</em>]</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The &ldquo;we&rdquo; to whom Jesus refers who speak of what they know and what they have seen are the prophets [<em>Joh 3:11</em>].</li>
    <li>The atonement requires Jesus&rsquo; death and His access to heaven (for intercession)</li>
    <li>The reason why people do not like Jesus is because they want to keep doing evil [<em>Joh 3:19-21</em>].</li>
    <li>What really causes condemnation is evil deeds, not that they did not come to the light [<em>Joh 3:19-21</em>].</li>
    <li>What causes condemnation is not that people did not come to Jesus, but because their deeds are evil [<em>Joh 3:19-21</em>].</li>
    <li>In the book of John, we do not really find the message of &ldquo;repent for the Kingdom of God is at hand&rdquo; as we do in the other gospels, however, it is present as seen in Jesus&rsquo; words to Nicodemus that men run away from the light because
        their deeds are evil. He was basically saying to leave evil deeds and come to the light [<em>Joh 3:19-22</em>].</li>
    <li>John the Baptist&rsquo;s birth was supernatural, but he referred to himself and other prophets as earthly, but he spoke of Jesus as one who came from above [<em>Joh 3:31</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus has the Spirit without measure, but He is dependent on the Spirit. God, however, does not need the Spirit. Even the Spirit has to search the mind of God to know His deep things. In the same way, the Spirit also draws power from the Father and
        gives to Jesus and His messengers. Jesus depends on the Spirit, but God does not. [<em>Joh 3:34; 1Co 2:10-11</em>].</li>
</ol>
<h1>Sunday 9<sup>th</sup> April 2023 Message Summary Notes</h1>
<h2>Points from 2<sup>nd</sup> Corinthians 10</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We win spiritual battles using wisdom, not strength.</li>
    <li>Battles won by force, would have to be maintained by force.</li>
    <li>We wage war by taking the minds of people captive.</li>
    <li>We use irrefutable arguments to take the minds captive..</li>
    <li>God makes an argument in Isaiah 43 that He was the one who declared the former things and declare new things and challenges the gods to declare the future if they can.</li>
    <li>Prophecy is not God seeing the future, but God declaring/determining the future</li>
    <li>To imply that God sees rather than determining it is to say He has no control over the future, which means the future is greater than God.</li>
    <li>Devils steal prophecies when they hear God first decree them.</li>
    <li>Resurrection &ndash; being one of the new things God declared &ndash; is a uniquely Judaeo-Christian doctrine. The only other religion that speaks of the resurrection copied it from the Bible.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Points from John 3 &ndash; 5</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Jesus is called &ldquo;the Word&rdquo; by John in the first chapter, because He speaks the words of God [<em>Joh 3:31-34</em>].</li>
    <li>Job asked His friends what spirit spoke through them [<em>Job 26:4</em>], which means that spirits speak through people. Since Jesus has the Spirit of God without measure [<em>Joh 3:34</em>], He speaks the words of God like no other.</li>
    <li>The Jews who said Jesus made Himself equal with God did not believe in the trinity, therefore, this portion of scripture does not prove that God is a trinity. They had a non-trinitarian understanding of what Jesus meant when He claimed to be equal
        with God [<em>Joh 5:18</em>].</li>
    <li>The Jews called God their Father [<em>Joh 8:41</em>], but were offended when they said Jesus claimed to be equal to God. They were angry and sought to kill Him because He claimed that His Father (God) works [on the Sabbath], so He too works [on the
        Sabbath]. The Jews were sons of God, but were prohibited from working on the Sabbath, so if Jesus called God His father in the context of working on the Sabbath, they knew He meant His sonship was not as theirs, but a higher level of Sonship.
        [<em>Joh 5:18</em>]. Jesus was claiming to be an actual Son and not just a servant son as were the Jews.</li>
    <li>There are two resurrections in John 5. Jesus speaks of one resurrection where the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live [<em>Joh 5:25</em>]; and He speaks of the resurrection where ALL who are in their graves will
        hear His voice and rise [<em>Joh 5:28-29</em>].</li>
    <li>There are two groups of people who partake of the Last Resurrection. Those who have done good will rise to life, and those who did not do good, will rise to condemnation [<em>Joh 5:28-29</em>].</li>
</ul>
<h1>Wednesday 12<sup>th</sup> April 2023 Message Summary Notes</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Man was made to manage creation [<em>Gen 2:5, 15</em>].</li>
    <li>God loves man because man is made in His Image.</li>
    <li>God chose man because they are weak [<em>Deu 7:6-7</em>].</li>
    <li>John teaches in his gospel that Jesus came to give us life.</li>
    <li>A man&rsquo;s righteousness cannot gain him access to the Tree of Life, even if he has never sinned. Adam&rsquo;s transgression hinders us from entering the presence of God where the Tree of Life is.
        <ul>
            <li>Would one be able to return what Adam stole from the garden?</li>
            <li>Man lost the right to the garden in Adam</li>
            <li>Man needs another right, another lineage to gain access to the garden again.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Law of Moses was another chance for man to gain life; it made men God&rsquo;s people again, and offered life.</li>
    <li>Eternal life is proof of sonship [<em>Joh 2:16-22</em>].</li>
    <li>A principle taken for granted in scriptures is that God does not do miracles Himself, but He operates through a vessel (Prophet). We cannot find the prophet who raised Jesus from the dead, so He must have raised Himself.</li>
    <li>The prophets and wise men of old knew that God had a Son [<em>Pro 30:4</em>]</li>
    <li>Jesus making a man whole on the Sabbath was a prophetic announcement that He was going to make man(kind) whole on the Sabbath (i.e., the resurrection).</li>
    <li>The human race, like Israel, was forsaken for 38 years in the wilderness, till they entered the land. In the same way, the lame man was lame for 38 years, till Jesus healed him on the Sabbath.</li>

<h1>Wednesday 19<sup>th</sup> April 2023 Message Summary Notes</h1>
<h2>Notes from John</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When the apostles speaks of Jesus before His incarnation, they do not refer to Him as Jesus, but as the word [<em>Joh 1:1</em>], the Spiritual Rock [<em>1Co 10:4</em>] etc.</li>
    <li>This is because He was not Jesus (by name) before His incarnation.</li>
    <li>If Jesus&rsquo; brother&rsquo;s believed in Him, they would not have questioned His way of doing things [<em>Joh 7:3-5</em>].</li>
    <li>Believing in Jesus is believing that He is the Son of God, the Christ, [<em>Joh 20:30-31</em>], not just a prophet or a miracle worker.</li>
    <li>God gave them miracles that they might believe that He (Jesus) is the Son of God.</li>
    <li>If the people believed, they would not have been asking Jesus for signs.</li>
    <li>Jesus asked the people to examine His doctrine, to find out whether His teaching comes from God, or He speaks on His own [<em>Joh 7:17</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus did not speak of Himself [<em>Joh 7:17</em>].</li>
    <li>One of the ways heaven measures righteousness is by whether or not you seek God&rsquo;s glory [<em>Joh 7:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Because God promises something does not mean it will always happen immediately. Jesus said He would give living water to the thirsty who asked. However, John says He spoke of the Holy Spirit He would give to them after His glorification [<em>Joh 7:37-39</em>].
        This means that if they had asked at the time He told them to, they would not have received the Holy Spirit, because Christ had not yet been glorified.</li>
    <li>The Father is the God of Israel [<em>Joh 8:54</em>]</li>
</ul>
<h1>Wednesday 26<sup>th</sup> April 2023 Message Summary Notes</h1>
<h2>Notes from John 11</h2>
<ul>
    <li>John wrote as if the reader already knows the life of Jesus. He expects the readers to know of the Mary who anointed Jesus&rsquo; feet [<em>Joh 1:3</em>].</li>
    <li>John considered those among the rulers of Israel who played it safe by not confessing Jesus &ndash; despite their belief in him &ndash; because of fear of being put out of the Synagogue to be cowards [<em>Joh 12:42-43</em>].</li>
    <li>It is not that they did not love the praise of God; it was that they loved the praise of men more than they loved God [<em>Joh 12:43</em>].</li>
    <li>The doctrine of the trinity makes Jesus the hero at God&rsquo;s expense. If the &ldquo;Godhead&rdquo; (as they say) is equal in power, authority, wisdom etc, then He is the only one who really did the work in dying for us.</li>
    <li>The Father is the one who sent Jesus. It is the Father who initiated the work. It does not rob Jesus of His glory and praise for His obeying the Father.</li>
    <li>Jesus teaches hoe to interpret scripture when He says to His disciples that He goes to prepare a place for them [<em>Joh 14:2-3</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; statement to Philip in John 14:9 confirms that He is the Angel of Yahweh. Philip asked to be shown the Father, but Jesus said, &ldquo;anyone who has seen me has seen the Father&rdquo;. It is only the Angel of Yahweh we know to be the
        One men saw and equated to God [<em>Joh 14:9</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus&rsquo; miracles were done through Him by the Father, because He is in the Father and the Father is in Him [<em>Joh 14:11</em>].</li>
    <li>The world will not see Jesus upon His return. They will see the sign of His return, but will not actually see Him. It is those who see Him who will explain to the nations what they witnessed upon the day of His return [<em>Joh 14:19-21; Mat 24:30; Isa 66:19</em>].</li>
    <li>Those who love God are those who have His commands and obey them [<em>Joh 14:21</em>].</li>
    <li>Those who love Jesus obey His teaching [<em>Joh 14:23</em>].</li>

<h2>Notes from John 13 &ndash; 17</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The Father is greater than Jesus because Jesus was sent by the Father [<em>Joh 14:16</em>].</li>
    <li>Women are to be known for service.</li>
    <li>Receiving Jesus is receiving God who sent Him. Before Jesus, receiving Moses, or any of the true prophets was receiving God [<em>Joh 14:20</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus also gave to the poor [<em>Joh 14:39</em>].</li>
    <li>The Father is glorified in the Son, when the Son completes the work the Father sent Him to do [<em>Joh 17:1-4</em>].</li>
    <li>Jesus loved His own to the end, and showed them the full extent of His love [<em>Joh 13:1</em>]. How does Jesus show them His love

            <li>He washed their feet (i.e., He served them).</li>

    <li>The disciples were washed by the word Jesus taught them [<em>Joh 15:3</em>]</li>
    <li>Without Jesus, we can do nothing. This verse seems to teach that the fruit we are to bear in Him is power [<em>Joh 15:1-5</em>].</li>
