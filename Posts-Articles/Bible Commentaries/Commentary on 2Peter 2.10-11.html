    <h1>Commentary on 2Peter 2:10-11</h1>
</header>
<blockquote>
    <p><sup>10</sup>But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they, selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.
        <br /><sup>11</sup>Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring not railing accusation against them before the Lord. [2Pe 2:10-11 KJV]</p>
</blockquote>
<h1>2Peter 2:10</h1>
<p><em>cf., </em>1Pe 2:11-14; Rom 13:1-5</p>
<h2>Key Points, Observations and Deductions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>The two offences of here are
        <ol>
            <li>Despising government and</li>
            <li>Blaspheming <strong><em>d&oacute;xas</em></strong>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Both offences have disregard for authority and power in common.</li>
    <li>From his first letter, we can see that &ldquo;government&rdquo; is a reference to earthly governments [1Pe 2:11-14]. <em>(please, see &ldquo;<a href="#vbd1234">Verse Breakdown</a>&rdquo; below)</em>. Peter charged us in his first letter to,
        <ol>
            <li>&ldquo;Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.&rdquo; [1Pe 2:17]</li>
            <li>Since Peter clearly has earthly kings in mind, the government that these men blaspheme are human governments <em>(please, see &ldquo;<a href="#vbd1234">Verse Breakdown</a>&rdquo; below for greater detail)</em>.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>These men are &ldquo;<strong>presumptuous</strong>&rdquo; [KJV], &ldquo;<strong>bold</strong>&rdquo; [ESV], &ldquo;<strong>brazen</strong>&rdquo; [NET] <em>(&tau;&omicron;&lambda;&mu;&eta;&tau;ή&sigmaf;, tolmētḗs, G5113)</em>.</li>
    <li>Their self will and presumptuousness is the reason why they are not afraid to blaspheme <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>.</li>
    <li>Their lack of fear is not courage but folly.</li>
    <li>They ought to be afraid of speaking evil of these <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>. This is an implication of, <em>&ldquo;<strong>they are not afraid to speak evil of d&oacute;xas</strong>&rdquo;</em></li>
    <li>Why should they be afraid to speak evil of the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>? It is either
        <ol>
            <li>The <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>are more powerful than they and can personally harm or punish them for being disrespectful of their power or</li>
            <li>The <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>are greater in authority before God than they and God expects them to be respected and so will punish those who blaspheme them. Or</li>
            <li>Both, the second being the more important of the two.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The next verse&mdash;&ldquo;Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might&rdquo; [2Pe 2:11]&mdash;indicates that it is the first. They ought to be afraid of the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>because they are more powerful than them.
        <ol>
            <li>The second position is still true for it is God who empowered these dignities and expects them to be honored.</li>
            <li>This is just as we are to honor those in authority because they were appointed by God [Rom 13:1-5]. There in Rom 13:1-5 too, the reason to fear the authorities is twofold,
                <ol>
                    <li>Because they have power to punish and also</li>
                    <li>Because of conscience, i.e., because of God.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>This is also similar to king Saul who was respected by David though he had been rejected by God because he was nonetheless God&rsquo;s anointed.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="vbd1234">Verse Breakdown</h2>
<p>This verse has two parts, two offences</p>
<ol>
    <li>The first having to do with the ungodly men <strong>despising government </strong>and</li>
    <li>The second having to do with blaspheming <strong><em>d&oacute;xas</em></strong>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>Recognizing this fact and giving attention to the different reasons stated by Peter why these men commit each offence is very helpful to understanding what Peter is saying.</p>
<h3>Blaspheming Doxas <em>(&delta;ό&xi;&alpha;, d&oacute;xa, G1391)</em></h3>
<p>Peter states the reason why these men are not afraid to blaspheme <em><strong>d&oacute;xas </strong></em>as</p>
<ol>
    <li>Being presumptuous <em>(&tau;&omicron;&lambda;&mu;&eta;&tau;ή&sigmaf;, tolmētḗs, G5113)</em>and</li>
    <li>Selfwilled <em>(&alpha;ὐ&theta;ά&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;, auth&aacute;dēs, G829)</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The connection here between the offence and the cause is self-evident.</p>
<p>It is clear from Peter&rsquo;s words that these men ought to have been afraid to blaspheme the doxas. Certainly, then, if they were not presumptuous <em>(i.e., bold, brazen) </em>and self-willed, they wouldn&rsquo;t have been bold to blaspheme the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>.
    Their being self-willed makes them to ignore the fact that these doxas are stronger than them. Being self-willed, they just want to do whatever they have decided to do.</p>
<h3>Despising Government / Authority <em>(&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;ό&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, kyri&oacute;tēs, G2963)</em></h3>
<p>The reason Peter states for their despising government <em>(&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;ό&tau;&eta;&sigmaf;, kyri&oacute;tēs, G2963) </em>is that</p>
<ol>
    <li>They walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness.</li>
</ol>
<p>Peter&rsquo;s first letter is helpful to understanding what he is saying here.</p>
<p>In Peter&rsquo;s first letter, he charged the believers in Christ to conduct themselves well among the Gentiles by</p>
<ol>
    <li>Abstaining &ldquo;&hellip;from fleshly lusts&hellip;&rdquo;, and</li>
    <li>Submitting to every human institution&mdash;king and governors</li>
    <li>For the sake of the Lord <em>(&kappa;ύ&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;, k&yacute;rios, G2962) </em>[1Pe 2:11-14]</li>
</ol>
<p>We can see then, that, one of the consequences of walking after the lusts of the flesh is despising authority, not submitting to it. But which authority does Peter here have in mind</p>
<ol>
    <li>Is it the earthly rulers to whom we are supposed to submit for the Lod&rsquo;s sake, or</li>
    <li>Is it the Lord for whose sake we are supposed to submit to every human institution?</li>
</ol>
<p>While we can easily find scriptures and present arguments in favor of the Lord, Peter&rsquo;s choice of word, &ldquo;Lordship / authority / government&rdquo; <em>(<strong>&kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&iota;ό&tau;&eta;&sigmaf; </strong>, kyri&oacute;tēs, G2963)</em>rather
    than &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; <em>(</em><strong><em>&kappa;ύ&rho;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf; </em></strong><em>, k&yacute;rios, G2962)</em>indicates he has the human authorities in mind <em>(and all authorities&mdash;natural and spiritual&mdash;in general)</em>.</p>
<p>In scriptures, except context determines otherwise, &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo; is a title specific God the Father and/or Jesus Christ. &ldquo;Lordship&rdquo;, on the other hand, is broad and, though it can refer to the Lord can refer to any other ruler.</p>
<p>In addition to this, it should be noted that &ldquo;Lordship&rdquo; is without the article and so is not pointing to anyone in particular, and certainly not the Lord.</p>
<p>If Peter had God the Father or Jesus Christ in mind, then he would have used the more specific title associated with him in the Scriptures, &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;. The fact that he did not use &ldquo;the Lord&rdquo;, therefore, means that he did not have
    the Lord in mind but in fact the earthly <em>(and, in general, all)</em>authorities. &ldquo;Lordship&rdquo; is not specific to the Lord. Therefore, it was earthly rulers he had in mind and not the Lord.</p>
<h1>2Peter 2:11</h1>
<p><em>cf., </em>Jud 1:9</p>
<ul>
    <li><i>We use &ldquo;</i><em><strong>d&oacute;xa</strong></em><i>&rdquo;, the transliteration of the original greek word translated as &ldquo;dignities&rdquo;[KJV], &ldquo;glorious ones&rdquo; [ESV] or &ldquo;celestial beings&rdquo; [NIV].</i>
    </li>
    <li><i>This is till we have determined their identity.</i>
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Key Points, Observations and Deductions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Angels are servants of God like we are.</li>
    <li>They are apparently cited as examples for us to emulate&mdash;since angels don&rsquo;t blaspheme them, then we shouldn&rsquo;t blaspheme as well.</li>
    <li>From the preceding verse [2Pe 2:10], we can see that the dignities are more powerful than the blasphemers since they ought to have been afraid to blaspheme them.</li>
    <li>Three levels of power and might,
        <br />
        <ol>
            <li>The angels are the highest in power and might. They are greater in power and might than the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>,</li>
            <li>The <em><strong>d&oacute;xas </strong></em>are greater in power and might than men,</li>
            <li>Men are the least in power and might. Men are lesser than the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>who are lesser than the angels in power and might.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>The angels are greater in power and might than these men and have nothing to fear from these &ldquo;dignities&rdquo;. Nevertheless, they do not blaspheme <em>&ldquo;them&rdquo;</em>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>&ldquo;&hellip;angels, who are greater in power and might&rdquo; than who?
        <ol>
            <li>The blasphemers or</li>
            <li>The <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong>(glories, dignities) </em>that they blaspheme [2Pe 2:10]?</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>Who are the <em>&ldquo;<strong>d&oacute;xas</strong>&rdquo; </em>that these men blaspheme?
        <ol>
            <li>Holy elect angels?</li>
            <li>Satan and the rulers of darkness?</li>
            <li>Men in authority?</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Some Guiding Facts</h3>
<ol>
    <li>These men blaspheme glories <em>(dignities) </em>[2Pe 2:10]</li>
    <li>An evil angel withstood Gabriel for 3 weeks until Michael came to help him [Dan 10:12-13]</li>
    <li>Apparently, the angels of darkness are also very powerful, and some are more powerful than some holy angels [Dan 10:12-13]</li>
    <li>Satan and rulers of the darkness of this world and elect angels of God are all more powerful than men. Even the least of them is more powerful than the strongest and greatest of men.</li>
    <li>Satan accuses believers before God day and night [Rev 12:10]</li>
    <li>Michael did not blaspheme the devil when he opposed him concerning the body of Moses [Jud 1:9]</li>
</ol>
<h2>Answer</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Them&rdquo; </strong><em>(who the angels do not blaspheme in judgment&hellip;) </em><strong>are the d&oacute;xas and not the blaspheming men</strong>.</p>
<p>First, we must remember that the devil brings accusations against men before the Lord, day and night. Therefore, those that the angels do not bring a blasphemous charge / judgment / condemnation against before the Lord cannot be men. Except we do not
    consider Satan to be an angel.</p>
<p>Whether or not we accept the above, however, proper attention to Peter&rsquo;s points in the verse [2Pe 2:10-11] shows conclusively that &ldquo;them&rdquo; is a reference to <strong>the </strong><em><strong>d&oacute;xas </strong></em>and not to <strong>the men blaspheming them</strong>.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whoever <strong>the </strong><em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>are in 2Pe 2:10, Peter just stated that they are more powerful than <strong>the men blaspheming</strong> them [2Pe 2:10].
        <ul>
            <li>By referring to those they blaspheme as <strong>&ldquo;</strong><em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em><strong>&rdquo; </strong>and</li>
            <li>By stating that these men ought to be afraid to blaspheme <strong>the </strong><em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>,</li>
            <li>Peter has plainly stated that these doxas are more powerful than the men [2Pe 2:10].</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Whoever &ldquo;<strong>them</strong>&rdquo; is, Peter states that <strong>the angels</strong> are more powerful than <strong>&ldquo;them&rdquo;</strong> [2Pe 2:11]</li>
</ul>
<p>The question then is, are the <strong>&ldquo;them&rdquo; </strong>the doxas of 2Pe 2:10 or are<strong> the blasphemers</strong>?</p>
<ul>
    <li>Since Peter just pointed out that the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>are more powerful than the men blaspheming them, if the <em><strong>d&oacute;xas</strong></em>and the angels are the same, then he has just stated that the angels are more powerful
        than the men blaspheming them.</li>
    <li>Therefore, since Peter just stated that the angels are more powerful than the men, then <strong>&ldquo;them&rdquo;</strong> in this verse cannot be referring to those same men.
        <ul>
            <li>If <strong>&ldquo;them&rdquo;</strong> is referring to <strong>the blaspheming men</strong>, it would mean that Peter is saying in this verse that <strong>the angels</strong> are more powerful than <strong>the blasphemers</strong>.<em> (which is exactly what he just said in the preceding part)</em></li>
            <li>This would be pointless repetition since that is the very point he just made in the preceding verse&mdash;<em>&ldquo;the <strong>d&oacute;xas</strong>/angels are more powerful than the men blaspheming them&rdquo;</em>.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Therefore, since Peter just stated that <strong>the angels </strong><em>(*if it is the angels he was referring to as <strong>d&oacute;xas</strong>) </em>are more powerful than <strong>the men</strong>, then he wouldn&rsquo;t be <em>pointlessly </em>repeating
        the point by saying that <strong>the angels </strong>are more powerful than <strong>&ldquo;them&rdquo;</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>&ldquo;Them&rdquo; </strong><em>(who the angels do not blaspheme in judgment&hellip;) </em><strong>are the doxas and not the blaspheming men</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Confirmation From Jude</h3>
<p>That this deduction is true can be easily seen from the book of Jude where Jude. Jude wrote of the very same matter but when a step further by giving an actual example. In this example, the angel is the Archangel Michael and the one he does not blaspheme
    against is the devil [Jud 1:9].</p>
<p>In Jude&rsquo;s example, Michael does not seem to be standing before the Lord&mdash;if he was, the devil wouldn&rsquo;t have been addressing him directly. Therefore, except they were both actually before the Lord, then simply saying, &ldquo;The Lord rebuke
    you&rdquo; bringing a charge against the devil &ldquo;before the Lord&rdquo;. Therefore, bringing a charge against them is not wrong rather it is bringing a &ldquo;blasphemous&rdquo; charge against them that is wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, these men blaspheme evil spirits and one of the possible occasions for doing so is casting devils out. Therefore, these men go around casting out demons and in doing so, blaspheme them.</p>
<h3>Example of Conclusion From Acts</h3>
<p>In the book of Acts, we read of such men among whom were some seven sons of Jewish high priest named Sceva [Act 19:13-16].</p>
<p>Now, this account does not include blasphemy in terms of an insult or cursing. Nevertheless, the action of the seven sons of Sceva is treated by the evil spirit as an insult to him. In other words, the seven sons of Sceva actual blasphemed that demon
    by commanding it to leave without due authority from the Lord.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Jesus I know, and Paul I know about, but you, who are you?</p>
    <span>[Act 19:15 ABP]</span>
</blockquote>
<p>So, these men are men who meddle in matters they do not understand or have authority in. Such is their trying to cast out devils.
</p>
<h3>Lessons and Implication of Peter&rsquo;s Doctrine</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Apparently, simply being a Christian does not give you power or authority over devils.</li>
    <li>Even demons can be unlawfully blasphemed.</li>
    <li>If <em><strong>d&oacute;xas </strong></em>who are lesser than angels in power and might can be blasphemed, then angels can more certainly be blasphemed.</li>
</ol>
