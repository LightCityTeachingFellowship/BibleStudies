    <h1>Love In the Spirit - (A Commentary on Col 1:8)</h1>

<!--excerpt.start-->
<p><em>Why does Paul say that they &ldquo;love&nbsp;<u>in the Spirit</u>&rdquo; and not just that they &ldquo;love&rdquo;?</em></p>
<p><em>All mention of &ldquo;love&rdquo; (ἀ&gamma;ά&pi;&eta;, ag&aacute;pē, G26) in the Book of Colossians (except for in&nbsp;Col 3:19&nbsp;about husbands and their wives) is for the brothers/saints [Col 1:4;&nbsp;2:2;&nbsp;3:14].</em></p><!--excerpt.end-->
<h1>Key Points, Observations and Deductions</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Their love in the Spirit is their love for all the saints [Col 1:4].
        <ol>
            <li>The way he speaks of their &ldquo;love in the Spirit&rdquo; he has already spoken of it before this point. He is not writing as if this is the first mention of it.</li>
            <li>Therefore, we look back to where he has spoken of it.</li>
            <li>We do not find the exact or similar phrase, &ldquo;love in the Spirit&rdquo; before this verse&nbsp;<em>(or even after anywhere else in the book)</em>.</li>
            <li>However, we find him speaking of their &ldquo;love for all the saints&rdquo; and this is a major point [Col 1:4].</li>
            <li>Therefore, their &ldquo;love in the Spirit&rdquo; is really their &ldquo;love for all the saints&rdquo;.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
    <li>To &ldquo;love in the Spirit&rdquo; is to say they are not loving in the flesh&nbsp;<em>(or under the Law of Moses)&mdash;</em>the Spirit is opposite to flesh [Rom 8:5].
        <ol>
            <li>The love is not carnal, it is not fleshly love.</li>
            <li>The Spirit is opposite to
                <ol>
                    <li>The flesh [Rom 8:5;&nbsp;Gal 5:16-17] and also</li>
                    <li>To the Law [Gal 5:18;&nbsp;2Cor 3:6]</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>We are to love as a fruit of the Spirit of God [Gal 5:22]
                <ol>
                    <li>Our love is only considered to be a fruit of the Spirit if we are led by the Spirit which requires that we be of the Spirit and free from the Law,
                        <ol>
                            <li>Those under the Law do good works. Nevertheless, their works are not considered to be of the Spirit. Their righteousness is not of Christ or the Spirit but of themselves and of the Law and of the flesh [Php 3:9;&nbsp;Gal 3:3;&nbsp;5:3-5]</li>
                            <li>A man can&rsquo;t be under the Law and still be under the Spirit; you can&rsquo;t be under the Old Covenant and still be under the New Covenant at the same time [Gal 5:18;&nbsp;5:1-5;&nbsp;2Cor 3:6-11].</li>
                            <li>Therefore, no matter the good work or character one has, it is not considered of the Spirit except one has the Holy Spirit [Gal 5;&nbsp;6;&nbsp;Rom 8:9,13-14<em>ff</em>].</li>
                            <li>Now, for one to benefit from the Spirit, one has to belong to Christ [Rom 8:2]</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                    <li>To be led by the Spirit
                        <ol>
                            <li>One has to have the Spirit [Rom 8:9]</li>
                            <li>But, to receive the Spirit, one has to be of faith [Gal 3:2]</li>
                            <li>And must be free from the Law [Gal 3:3;&nbsp;5:2-5]</li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
