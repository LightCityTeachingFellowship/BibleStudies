<h1>Angel of Yahweh Grand Deductions and Conclusion</h1>
<h2>He is a particular angel</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Although the title, "the Angel of Yahweh", generally applies to any of the many angels of Yahweh, the angel referred to as THE Angel of Yahweh is a particular angel.</li>
	<li>This is the most important fact in all this study</li>
	<li>Knowing that the Angel is a particular angel, we may then proceed to identifying him by studying that facts about him. <em>The big challenge is that the title "angel of Yahweh</em><em>" is generic so that whether preceded by the definite article or not, we can't be too sure of who we are looking at at any point in time.</em></li>
</ol>
<h2>There are features and characteristics by which the Patriarchs recognized him</h2>
<p>While those who met him may tell us through the scriptures that he was the one, the question is how did they know? How did they know?</p>
<ol>
	<li>His appearance.
		<ol>
			<li>This has to do with the fact that angels generally look different from us when they appear as men [Judges 13:8], they are more "awesome". This is not the most definitive of characteristics, however, it creates the suspicion.</li>
			<li>This is most evident in the words of Manoah's wife, "he looked awesome, like and angel of God".</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>His words.
		<ol>
			<li>His words are authoritative. He speaks with authority as God himself. He speaks as one having authority over the Israelites.</li>
			<li>This is most evident in the account of appearance of the Angel of Yahweh to Gideon. From his manner of speech, commanding Gideon as though he were Gideon's lord, Gideon suspected that he was the Angel of Yahweh, he was however not too sure and so asked for a sign to confirm this.</li>
			<li>We find evidence of this in the stories of his encounters with Hagar, Jacob, Moses, Balaam, Joshua.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>His power.
		<ol>
			<li>He is powerful. In fact, he is the most powerful angel. His miracles are outstanding. The Name Yahweh which he shares with God states that he has power over all of nature, and, in fact, that God created all things through him.</li>
			<li>That his power confirms his identity can be seen in the accounts of his dealings with the magicians of Egypt who confessed that he was God, "this is the finger of God". Also in His encounters with Gideon, Manoah and his wife</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2>His relationship to God is unique so that he can fully represent him and there is no angel greater than him</h2>
<p>He was called</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Judge of all the Earth</li>
	<li>The One who sees me</li>
	<li>The Presence/Face of God/Yahweh</li>
	<li>The Glory of God/Yahweh</li>
	<li>By the Yahweh--this Name shows him to be the creator of the world</li>
</ol>
<h2>The prayers, prophecies, roles and characteristics of this Angel are all fulfilled in Christ Jesus and since the Angel is unique, it means that he is the One that came as Jesus</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Many of Jesus' words show and confirm him to be the Angel of Yahweh</li>
	<li>Jesus' level of authority and power could not have been possessed by any other than the Angel of Yahweh</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Archangel Michael shares unique attributes with the Angel of Yahweh and since the Angel is unique, it means that he is the Archangel Michael</h2>
<ol>
	<li>They both bear the unique Name Yahweh</li>
	<li>Michael is quite plainly shown to be the Angel of Yahweh in the record of Judges 2 where the Angel of Yahweh came from the same place Michael was last seen in his meeting with Joshua. He declared himself, in the Name of Yahweh, to be the One that brought Israel out of Egypt and made a covenant with them.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Some other important and useful facts are</h2>
<ol>
	<li>The way he is introduced in scriptures, especially the earlier books of Genesis to Judges, show him to be an important figure, a key player in the unfolding story of the kingdom of God.</li>
	<li>The truth about him was lost in time but used to be known--the truth about him was known to saints <em>and even other men</em> before the flood and some time after, as far as Abraham's time
		<ol>
			<li>The beliefs of the patriarchs about him, even for men like Jacob in his first encounter with him, show that there was established doctrine about him in their times and before. For example, they evidently knew that he was not God, since they called him and angel, yet they evidently believed and regarded him to be equal to God. This is clear from their titles of him such as "the face of God' or "God". They believed that he was God's representative that seeing him was equal to seeing God; meeting with him was equal to meeting with God. They knew that God created the world through him. Even without telling them such things directly, they knew these things and spoke about them with total authority and confidence which could only be the result of it being established doctrine for them.
				<ol>
					<li>Jacob knew about him before wrestling with him. He believed that
						<ol>
							<li>Seeing him meant death</li>
							<li>He believed that he was God</li>
							<li>Nevertheless, he still knew that he was God's image and not God himself in person since he refers to him as "the Face of Yahweh"</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Abraham knew about him. We can see this from Hagar's first encounter with the Angel of Yahweh. She believed that
						<ol>
							<li>He saw her</li>
							<li>He was God</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Gideon knew him.
						<ol>
							<li>He was the only one that had such authority as he spoke with to Gideon</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Some of their doctrines about him and God are
						<ol>
							<li>There is only One God who is above all the gods/angels</li>
							<li>God has a representative, an Angel among his angels who is equal to God
								<ol>
									<li>He is special. He is unique among all God's angels</li>
									<li>He can be worshiped as God</li>
									<li>He has authority as God and so can speak with authority as Him</li>
									<li>To see him is to have seen God</li>
									<li>He is as powerful as God</li>
									<li>He bears the Creator Name of God, i.e., Yahweh</li>
									<li>He is under God</li>
									<li>He sees men, especially the saints, those who belong to him</li>
									<li>To see him means death</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>God created the world through him
								<ol>
									<li>Evidently, from His Name, Yahweh, and from following the narrative from Genesis 1, he is the One through whom God created the world.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>Jesus' humanity, death and resurrection and all the benefits coming from it are consistent with the roles and duties of the Angel of Yahweh. For example,
								<ol>
									<li>The Angel of Yahweh is described by Elihu in the Book of Job as "one out of a thousand" who stands for the condemned and provides atonement for him.</li>
								</ol>
							</li>
							<li>While some of the doctrines of the Apostles regarding Jesus can be gotten from prophecies regarding the Messiah, many can only be deduced from believing that he was the Angel of Yahweh.</li>
