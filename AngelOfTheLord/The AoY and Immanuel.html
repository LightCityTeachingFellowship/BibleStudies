<h1>The Prophecy<em>—Emmanuel Will Deliver Jerusalem from an Assyrian Invasion</em></h1>
<p>Below are the prophesies about Emmanuel especially in connection to Assyria and Jerusalem.</p>
<h2>Emmanuel Will Deliver Jerusalem from the Assyrian Invasion</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>Because this people has rejected <strong>the gently flowing waters of Shiloah</strong> and rejoices over Rezin and the son of Remaliah, <sub>7</sub>therefore Adonai is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the River&mdash;<strong>the king of Assyria</strong> with all his pomp. It will overflow all its channels, run over all its banks<sub>8</sub>and sweep on into Judah, swirling over it, passing through it and reaching up to the neck. Its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land, <strong>O Immanuel</strong>!&rdquo;<br>
	<sub>9</sub>Raise the war cry, you nations, and be shattered! Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, and be shattered! Prepare for battle, and be shattered! <sub>10</sub>Devise your strategy, but it will be thwarted; propose your plan, but it will not stand, for <strong>God is with us</strong>. [Isa 8:7-8,9-10]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Important Points</em></h3>
<ol>
	<li>The prophecy is directed to <strong>Immanuel</strong>.</li>
	<li>The prophecy states that the King of Assyria would invade the land of Judah and almost destroy it, like a flooding river that almost drowns a man but then stops. The army of the king of Assyria will reach to the neck, coming close to submerging and drowning the head, that is Jerusalem, but it will not succeed.</li>
	<li>Knowing that <strong>Immanuel</strong> means &ldquo;<strong>God with us</strong>&rdquo;, the last verse of this prophecy as quoted above shows that the invasion of the land of Judah will fail because of <strong>Immanuel</strong><br>
	<em>In other words, Emmanuel will deliver Jerusalem</em></li>
</ol>
<h2>The Assyrian Army Will Be Destroyed With A Disease</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>Woe to the Assyrian, the rod of my anger, in whose hand is the club of my wrath! <sub>6</sub>I send him against a godless nation&hellip; to seize loot and snatch plunder, and to trample them down like mud in the streets. <sub>7</sub>But this is not what he intends&hellip;<br>
	<sub>16</sub>Therefore, <strong>Adonai</strong>, <strong>Yahweh of Hosts</strong>, will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors; under his pomp a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame. <sub>17</sub><strong>The Light of Israel</strong> will become a fire, <strong>their Holy One</strong> a flame; in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers. <sub>18</sub>The splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy, as when a sick man wastes away. <sub>19</sub>And the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down. [Isa 10:16-19]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Important Points</em></h3>
<ol>
	<li>This prophecy plainly and figuratively states the manner in which the Assyrian army would be destroyed</li>
	<li>Since <strong>Immanuel</strong> is the One who deliverers Jerusalem from the Assyrian invasion in the prophecy quoted before this, it means that Immanuel is the One this prophecy refers to as</li>
	<ol>
		<li>Adonai, Yahweh of Hosts</li>
		<li>The Light of Israel,</li>
		<li>Israel&rsquo;s Holy One</li>
	</ol>
</ol>

<h1>The Fulfillment<em>—The Angel of Yahweh Delivers Jerusalem from Assyria</em></h1>
<p>The above prophecies were fulfilled in the lifetime of the prophet Isaiah during the reign of king Hezekiah. The fulfillment of the prophecy fully aligns with the prophecy itself. An obvious difference being that the Immanuel of this prophecy is not human.</p>
<h2>The Angel of Yahweh delivers Jerusalem from the Assyrian Army</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>I will defend this city and save it, for my sake and for the sake of David my servant!&rdquo;<sub>36</sub>Then <strong>the Angel of Yahweh</strong> went out and put to death a hundred and eighty-five thousand men in the Assyrian camp. When the people got up the next morning&mdash;there were all the dead bodies! <sub>37</sub>So Sennacherib king of Assyria broke camp and withdrew. He returned to Nineveh and stayed there. [Isa 37:35-36]</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><em>Important Points</em></h3>
<ol>
	<li>Just as prophesied, the Assyrian invaded the land of Judah and came as far as Jerusalem.</li>
	<li>Just as prophesied, the invading Assyrian army was destroyed with a wasting disease and the Assyrian king had to break camp</li>
	<li>The Immanuel who delivers Jerusalem from the Assyrian army is the Angel of Yahweh</li>
</ol>

<h1>Deduction<em>—The Angel of Yahweh is the Prophesied Emmanuel</em></h1>
<p>The fulfilment of the prophecy recorded by Isaiah shows the Angel of Yahweh to be the prophesied Immanuel. The only difference between this Immanuel and the prophesied Immanuel is that the Angel of Yahweh was not conceived or born of a woman<em>, at least not at this point in time</em>.</p>
<p>Now, that the Angel of Yahweh is Immanuel perfectly agrees with Scriptures preceding Isaiah. As a matter of fact, the only &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; that Israel ever knew was the Angel of Yahweh.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Jacob spoke of him as the God of his fathers Abraham and Isaac and the one who had delivered him from all troubles [Gen 48:15-16].</li>
	<li>Moses recognized the Angel of Yahweh whom Yahweh was sending with him and Israel as God with them [Exo 33:12-17; 23:20-23]</li>
</ol>
<p>Other aspects of Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, in connection to this prophecy, confirm this conclusion that the Angel of Yahweh is the prophesied Immanuel.</p>

<h2>The Light and Holy One of Israel</h2>
<p>The second prophecy quoted above calls Emmanuel &ldquo;<strong>the Light of Israel</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This is quite instructive because Isaiah before this described the Messiah who would inherit the Throne of David as &ldquo;<strong>a great light</strong>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Since this prophecy was fulfilled by the Angel of Yahweh, it means that the Angel of Yahweh is &ldquo;Adonai, Yahweh of Hosts, the Light of Israel and Israel&rsquo;s Holy One.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Isaiah is speaking of Immanuel is also confirmed by his calling the Messiah &ldquo;<strong>Mighty God</strong>&rdquo; [Isa 9:6] and &ldquo;<strong>a great light</strong>&rdquo; [Isa 9:2,6-7].</p>
<p>If the Messiah is &ldquo;Mighty God&rdquo; and he is given to &lsquo;us&rsquo;, then he is &ldquo;God with us&rdquo;&mdash;Immanuel. Now, not only does Isaiah indicate that he is Immanuel by calling him &ldquo;Mighty God&rdquo;, but he also calls him &ldquo;a great light&rdquo; and &ldquo;a light&ldquo; [Isa 9:2,6-7]. If the Messiah is a Great Light and he is Israel&rsquo;s King, then he is the Light of Israel. Therefore, when Isaiah goes on to prophesy that they will be delivered from the Assyrian army by &ldquo;the Light of Israel&rdquo;, he is in fact saying that they will be delivered by Immanuel the Messiah.</p>
<p>Now, if Immanuel is who delivers his people is the Light of Israel, then he is Israel&rsquo;s Holy One and Adonai, Yahweh of Hosts. Now, these titles are in fact titles true of the Angel of Yahweh and belonging to him, therefore, these titles confirm that the prophesied Immanuel is indeed the Angel of Yahweh.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Adonai, Yahweh of Hosts<br /></strong>We can see from Hosea, where he identifies the man who wrestled with Jacob as an angel that the Angel of Yahweh is &ldquo;Yahweh Elohim of Hosts&rdquo; [Hos 12:2-5].</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Israel&rsquo;s Holy One<br /></strong>Angels are generally holy ones [Dan 4:8-9,13,17] and since God appointed different angels over the nations, every nation has her own holy one [Deut 32:8-9; Gen 11:6-7; Dan 10:13,20].<br />Therefore, since the Angel of Yahweh is an Angel of God, he is a holy one and since he is the Captain or Prince of Israel, he is therefore Israel&rsquo;s Holy One [Exo 23:20-23; 33:10-17; Jos 5:14; Dan 8:11]. Therefore, when Isaiah speaks of Immanuel or the Messiah as Israel&rsquo;s holy one, he is saying that he is the Angel of Yahweh.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>The Light of Israel</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Addressing the Non-Humanity of the Immanuel of King Hezekiah&rsquo;s Day</h2>
<p>As far as can be plainly deduced from Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy, the Angel of Yahweh is the prophesied Immanuel. The only reason one may reject this conclusion is that he was not a human being at the time. This objection is, however, not as serious as it may sounds.</p>
<p>To be &ldquo;God with Us&rdquo; in the literal sense would require that he was already God at conception and birth. Therefore, since the Angel of Yahweh is the only &ldquo;God with us&rdquo; of Israel, the One to be born to the Virgin can only be &ldquo;God with Us&rdquo; if he was the Angel of Yahweh.</p>

					<p>This was not fulfilled in the days of King Hezekiah&mdash;the Angel of Yahweh at that time had not been in the womb of a woman.</p>
