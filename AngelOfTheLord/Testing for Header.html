An Important Principle and Observation
i.	Does God change as shifting shadows?
ii.	Does he change his plans and purposes?
The answer to this question is of course, NO [Num 23:19; 1Sa 15:29; Mic 7:20; Hab 2:3; Mal 3:6; Luk 21:33; Rom 11:29; Tit 1:2; Heb 6:18; Jas 1:17].
This is a most important truth about God and His ways—God does not change.
•	When God created man, he stated that he wanted man to have the dominion. Things went wrong. Men proved to be undeserving of such honor. Nevertheless, God’s plan and purpose for man never changed. What has become abundantly clear, especially under the New Covenant, is that God is still going through with His plan for man. This is just one sample of God never changing His plan.
We should take every word of God seriously. If God reveals a plan to us, then we should never without very clear revelation treat the plan like it has changed. Let us apply this, not only to men, but the Angel of Yahweh.
The Angel of Yahweh and God’s Consistency
Whatever God has said about the Angel of Yahweh, whatever attribute God has said or revealed He has given to him, whatever purpose God has said or revealed that He has ordained for him to fulfill, we must be careful not to deny the Angel of it or/and transfer it to someone else.
If God has said that the Angel of Yahweh will do a thing, then he is the one who will do it.
If that thing is being done, then it is the Angel of Yahweh who is doing it.
If the thing has been done, then it is the Angel of Yahweh who has done it.
If the Angel of Yahweh does not do it, then it means that he failed which would mean that God made a mistake about this Angel since he wasn’t able to do what God said he would do.
If God transferred a purpose meant for the Angel to someone else, even though the Angel did not fail in his assignment, then it means that God has changed his mind about the Angel. But why would God change his mind about the Angel? The only reason why God would do that is that the angel sins against God and proves to be unfaithful. In any case, God would be proven to have made a mistake about the Angel of Yahweh which is absurd.
a.	When God said that Moses was to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt, Moses did. Yes, Moses did not take them in, but that was never once stated as a purpose for Moses [Exo 3:7-10].
b.	Samson, like all men sinned, but his sin did not stop the stated purpose of God from being accomplished. When God said that Samson would begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines [Jdg 13:5], that was exactly what Samson did. Yes, he was so powerful and could even have finished it. No matter. He still accomplished the stated purpose for his birth—begin the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines.
c.	Although Elijah said he was tired [1Ki 19:4], nevertheless, the work he was meant to do which is to turn the hearts of Israel back to God [1Ki 18:37ff cf., Luk 1:16-17], he will still come back to finish [Mal 4:5-6].
If God says that he has given this Angel certain attributes, then except he tells us that he gave someone else, then if ever we find anyone with these attributes, especially when they are all complete in him, it is no other but the only one God told us has these attributes.
