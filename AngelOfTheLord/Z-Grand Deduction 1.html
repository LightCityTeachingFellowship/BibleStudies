	<h1>Christ is the Angel of Yahweh</h1>
	<p>Below is a summary of the facts and deductions from the record of the Scriptures that tell us that Jesus is the Angel of Yahweh.</p>
</div>
<h1>The Particularness of the Angel of Yahweh</h1>
<p>The first fact we note is that, although the title the &ldquo;Angel of Yahweh&rdquo;&nbsp;may apply to any angel of Yahweh, there is in fact a particular Angel of Yahweh in focus in scriptures. We can see that the Angel is a particular angel from the following facts among others,</p>
<ol>
	<li>His presentation in scriptures&mdash;the scriptures present him as a particular angel</li>
	<li>The testimony of Jacob speaking of&nbsp;&ldquo;the Angel of Yahweh&rdquo; as the God of Abraham and Isaac [Gen 48:15-16]. This cannot apply to more than one angel.</li>
	<li>The prayer of Moses blessing Joseph with &ldquo;the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush&rdquo; [Deut 33:16] who, by Moses&rsquo; identification, was the&nbsp;&ldquo;the Angel of Yahweh&rdquo; [Exo 3:2 <em>cf.,</em> Num 20:15-16; Act 7:30,35].&nbsp;Why this angel?&nbsp;Again, this cannot apply to more than one angel.<br />That this is the very same angel is confirmed in the fact that Moses was blessing the same son of Jacob&mdash;Joseph who had two tribes, Ephraim and Mannaseh&mdash;whom Jacob had blessed by the Angel.</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Importance and Usefulness of this Fact</h2>
<p>If we met&nbsp;Angel of Yahweh in another circumstance and form and he exhibitted the same characteristicsto of the Angel of Yahweh who appeared to Moses, how would we know that he was that Angel of Yahweh? If we weren&rsquo;t sure that the Angel of Yahweh was a particular angel, that is, that there is just one of his kind, how would we know?</p>
<p>Knowing with certainty that &ldquo;the Angel of Yahweh&rdquo; is a specific Angel makes it certain that whoever this angel is, his peculiar and definning attributes are unique to him. Therefore, whoever we find with these attributes is none other than the Angel of Yahweh... of Abraham, Hagar, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Joshua&nbsp;and Gideon.</p>
<h1>Jacob&rsquo;s Testimony</h1>
<p>Jacob identified the Angel of Yahweh with/as the God of Abraham and Isaac&nbsp;[Gen 48:15-16]. This conclusively means that</p>
<ol>
	<li>The Angel of Yahweh is God&mdash;Jacob&rsquo;s words plainly mean this.
		<ol>
			<li>That Jacob really takes the Angel to be God and what this means is confirmed by other accounts where the Angel of Yahweh is called by the Name Yahweh and God and treated as such.&nbsp;<em>(Jacob, however, wasn&rsquo;t thinking that God was an angel but that there was such a relationship between God and the Angel that the Angel was God. Jacob&rsquo;s words were born of a certain knowledge of God and His ways which is our interest to learn for ourselves.)</em></li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>The Angel of Yahweh is a Specific Angel&nbsp;since
		<ol>
			<li>Jacob is very clearly speaking of a particular angel and</li>
			<li>Surely, all the angels of God are not the God of Abraham and Isaac</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Important Deductions</strong></h2>
<ol>
	<li>This means that the Angel of Yahweh was the One Abraham related with as God</li>
	<li>All Jacob&rsquo;s sons are under the Angel of Yahweh<br /><em>(We should note that Jacob was adopting Ephraim and Manasseh as his sons when he blessed them by the Angel of Yahweh. Therfore, t</em><em>he blessing Jacob was giving to Ephraim and Manasseh was for all his sons and was not unique to them. This then means that all Jacob&rsquo;s sons are under the Angel of Yahweh.<br />In any case, since the Angel is the God of Abraham and Isaac and, evidently now, the God of Jacob, he is the God of all Jacob's descendants.)</em></li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Jesus is the Angel of Yahweh</strong></h2>
<p>The first deduction under this subsection, that the Angel of Yahweh was the One Abraham related with as God, by itself is sufficient to identify Jesus as the Angel of Yahweh.</p>
<ol>
	<li>First, since&nbsp;the Angel of Yahweh was the One Abraham related with as God, then the Angel of Yahweh was the <strong>Yahweh</strong> who appeared to Abraham in the company of two other angels [Gen 18:1].</li>
	<li>Second, Jesus identified himself as the Yahweh who had appeared to Abraham in the company of two angels, and gave him the promise regarding the birth of Isaac [Joh 8:56-58].</li>
	<li>Therefore, Jesus identified himself as the Angel of Yahweh&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h1>Recognizing the Angel of Yahweh</h1>
<p>The Angel of Yahweh rarely introduced himself to anyone, yet the saints recognized him. Hagar and men like Jacob and Gideon who had never met him recognized him the first time they met him even without any real introduction. Gideon&rsquo;s story [Judges 6:11-23] is quite helpful in understanding how these people were able to recogize the Angel of Yahweh and it is this</p>
<ol>
	<li>His speaking as though he were God himself and</li>
	<li>His power</li>
</ol>
<h2><strong>Jesus is the Angel of Yahweh</strong></h2>
<p>These by themselves point to Jesus as the AoY because he exhibited the very same attributes.</p>
<ol>
	<li>Just as the Angel of Yahweh, the Lord&nbsp;Jesus spoke and acted as though he were God with absolute authority [Mat 7:29; Joh 7:46]. And he did this just as the Angel of Yahweh without any explanation as to how this could be.</li>
	<li>And, just as the Angel of Yahweh, the Lord&nbsp;Jesus excercised the power as of God. This part is quite important because any deluded person could claim he was God but&nbsp;it is impossible to excercise the same power of God except you really were one [Joh 10:37].&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, this was the heart of his troubles with the Jews. <em>(Although they were not thinking that Jesus meant that he was God the Father)&nbsp;</em>They understood what his words and actions meant but found it hard to accept becasue, quite obviously, he was a man but Yahweh is certainly not a man&nbsp;[Joh 10:33].</p>
<p>In fact,&nbsp;Jesus, comparing himself to some other angels, identifies himself as &ldquo;the One whom the father sets apart as his very own&rdquo;&nbsp;[Joh 10:36]. In other words, he is the most unique, the most Holy, of all the Angels. This fits the representation of the Angel of Yahweh who clearly is unique among God&rsquo;s angels&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was the Angel of Yahweh.</p>
<h1>The Name of Yahweh</h1>
<p>We may add that the Name of Yahweh which the Angel of Yahweh bears is the same name the Jesus bears [Exo 23:20-21; Joe 2:32; Act 2:21; 4:12; Rom 10:12-13]</p>
<ol>
	<li>If Jesus is not the Angel of Yahweh, then Jesus is not the &ldquo;radiance of God&rsquo;s glory and the&hellip;.&rdquo;</li>
