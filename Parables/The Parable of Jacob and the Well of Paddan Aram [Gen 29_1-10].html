<p>The Parable of Jacob and the Well of Paddan Aram [Gen 29:1-10]</p>

<p>In the 29<sup>th</sup> Chapter of Genesis, it was recorded that when Jacob left Canaan for Paddan Aram in obedience to his father&rsquo;s instruction, he arrived at the land of the Eastern peoples; upon getting there, he saw a well with a large stone covering.
    Three flocks of sheep were lying near the well. The shepherds present at the well told Jacob that they could not give their sheep water from the well until all the shepherds had gathered with their flocks, then, the stone over the well would be rolled
    away and the sheep would drink. The shepherds told Jacob this at the well after he asked them to roll the stone and give water to their sheep.</p>
<p>While Jacob was talking with them, Rachael approached with her father&rsquo;s Sheep and Jacob rolled the stone over the well and watered Laban&rsquo;s Sheep.</p>
<p>The chapter tells the story of the beginning of Jacob&rsquo;s service to Laban, how he came to be married to Leah and Rachael and, the circumstances around the birth of his first four sons. All three events could have been recorded without including his
    encounter with the shepherds at the well. If Moses had recorded that Jacob got to the well, asked the Shepherds if they knew Laban and that after affirming, they pointed to Rachael who was approaching to water her father&rsquo;s sheep, the story would
    have been unaffected. The inclusion of the account of Jacob&rsquo;s interaction with the shepherds neither adds nor removes anything from the story but for some reason, Jacob chose to recount the story to his children who in turn told it to theirs
    and Moses thought it was significant that this strange and seemingly irrelevant information be added to the story.</p>

<p>The Apostles teach that the things recorded in the Old Testament are examples for us:</p>
<p><strong>For everything that was written in the past was written to teach us &hellip; [NIV'78 Rom 15:4]</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Now these things were our examples &hellip; [KJV 1Cor 10:6]</strong>
</p>

<p>Everything in scripture is written for our benefit so, this story of Jacob and the Shepherds must also have been written for our example. There is some lesson the Holy Spirit intends for us to learn from this story and as such Moses was led to tell it.</p>

<p>Jesus spoke in parables to the people [Matt 13:14; Mark 4:2,34 etc] and He did so to hide the secrets of the Kingdom of God from those who were not His (God&rsquo;s) children [Matt 13:10-17].</p>
<p>Jesus spoke God&rsquo;s word because was given the Spirit if God without measure [John 3:34].</p>
<p>Some of the followers of Jesus would have been confused at His speech after they would gather to Him, and He would begin to teach things that they could not understand [Matt 13:1-10].</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Christ and it was by this Spirit of Christ that the prophets [including but not limited to Moses] all spoke [1Pet 1:9-11]. The Spirit of Christ was speaking through Moses when he (Moses) wrote down this story; and
    just as He used to do in the days of His ministry on earth, His (Jesus&rsquo;) Holy Spirit was also telling a parable with this story [Heb 13:8].</p>
<p>The Spirit of Christ writing through Moses &ndash; in telling us this seemingly meaningless story &ndash; was telling us a parable. There is a hidden message in this part of the story.</p>

<h1><strong>The Meaning of the Parable</strong></h1>
<p>The parables of Jesus were about God&rsquo;s Kingdom and the events, places, times, and characters involved in it. This parable of the well is no different. It also speaks of the coming Kingdom of God.</p>

<p>The parable tells of the two resurrections. The curse of death is to be totally lifted at the judgment day when all the dead will rise and even Death and Hades would be judged. This is the time stated in scripture for all men to rise. However, at least
    a millennium before the appointed time for death to be destroyed, Jesus will return to the earth to redeem His people from death [Rev 20:4-6, 11-15].</p>
<p>Just as there was an appointed time for the shepherds to water their sheep, there is an appointed time for the dead to drink &lsquo;living water&rsquo; live again. The other shepherds whether because they lacked the ability to roll over the stone or they
    lacked the authority are not able to water their sheep until a certain time. Similarly, the rulers of this age lack both the power and authority to bring the dead to life and an appointed time has been set by the Father.</p>
